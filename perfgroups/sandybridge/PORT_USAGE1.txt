-
This group measures the execution port utilization in a CPU core. This group is
designed to be run over the same region with all other PORT_USAGE* groups. By
splitting the port usage calculations into multiple groups, port usage is able
to be calculated with hyperthreading enabled. 

Ratios of a given port's usage to the total usage of all ports must be
calculated by software that processes results, for instance by summing the uops
dispatched across all ports and then dividing each UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT_PORT_*
by that sum.
