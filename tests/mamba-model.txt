# Mamba Model
## Processor
### Architecture
 - A compute node has two Intel Xeon E5-2667 v3 processors OR two Intel Xeon
 E5-2667 v4. Nodes 5-8 are v4, nodes 1-4 are v3. Each processor has 8 physical
 cores. Hyperthreading is disabled.
 - the v3 processors use the Haswell microarchitecture, the v4 processors use
 the Broadwell microarchitecture

### Theoretical FLOP/s performance
 - (num processors) * (num physical cores per processor) * (cycles per second)
   * (instructions per cycle) * (operations per instruction) * (parallel
   instructions due to vector processing)
   - 2 processors
   - 8 cores per processor
   - 3.2 Ghz base clock speed
   - 2 instructions per cycle: 2 lanes that do floating point operations
   - 2 opearations per instruction: FMA does 2 operations simultaneously
   - float is 32 bits, can pack 8 into 256bit register.
 - 2 * 8 * 3 200 000 000 * 2 * 2 * 8 = 1638400000000
 - 1.64 * 10^12
 - 1.64 TFlop/s

### Theoretical IOP/s performance
 - (num processors) * (num physical cores per processor) * (cycles per second)
   * (instructions per cycle) * (operations per instruction) * (parallel
   instructions due to vector processing)
   - 2 processors
   - 8 cores per processor
   - 3.2 Ghz base clock speed
   - 3 instructions per cycle: 3 lanes that do VECTOR IOPs simultaneously
   - 1 operation per instruction
   - uint8 is 8 bits, can pack 32 into 256bit register
   - mul only supports 16 bit integers and up, so for the mul we can only pack
     16 into a 256bit register
 - 2 * 8 * 3 200 000 000 * (2 * 1 * 32 + 1 * 1 * 16) = 4096000000000
 - 4.10 * 10^12
 - 4.10 TIop/s
