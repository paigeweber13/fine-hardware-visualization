# Copperhead Model
## Processor
### Architecture
 - 1 4-core i5-6300U running at a base frequency of 2.4 GHz (3.0 GHz turbo)
 - what frequency does it run at when 4 cores are saturated?
   - my experiments show 2.9 Ghz on both battery and A/C

BELOW INFO NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

### Theoretical FLOP/s performance
 - (num processors) * (num cores per processor) * (cycles per second)
   * (instructions per cycle) * (operations per instruction) * (parallel
   instructions due to vector processing)
   - 1 processor
   - 4 cores per processor
   - 2.9 Ghz clock speed
   - 2 instructions per cycle: 2 lanes that do floating point fma
   - 2 opearations per instruction: FMA does 2 operations simultaneously
   - float is 32 bits, can pack 8 into 256bit register.
 - 1 * 4 * 2 900 000 000 * 2 * 2 * 8 = 1638400000000
 - 3.71 * 10^11
 - 371 GFlop/s
 - 185.5 GFlop/s theoretical without hyperthreading
 - experiments are giving me 0.100195 TFlop/s on 2 cores and 0.193845 TFlop/s
   on 4 cores with hyperthreading enabled
 - disabled cpu 1 and 3 on the OS level and got 0.091052 TFlop/s

### Theoretical IOP/s performance
 - (num processors) * (num physical cores per processor) * (cycles per second)
   * (instructions per cycle) * (operations per instruction) * (parallel
   instructions due to vector processing)
   - 1 processors
   - 4 cores per processor
   - 2.9 Ghz clock speed
   - 3 instructions per cycle: 3 lanes that do VECTOR IOPs simultaneously
   - 1 operation per instruction
   - uint8 is 8 bits, can pack 32 into 256bit register
   - mul only supports 16 bit integers and up, so for the mul we can only pack
     16 into a 256bit register
 - 1 * 4 * 2 900 000 000 * (3 * 1 * 32) = 1.1136 * 10^12
 - 1.11 * 10^12
 - 1.11 TIop/s
