# Plan for remainder of Riley's time (through June 2021)

## By April 14 - Confirm soundness of tool

- Micro-benchmarks (ex. a benchmark designed to maximize flops)
  - memory benchmark does not saturate BW. Consider instrumenting likwid
    benchmark or [stream benchmark](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/)
    with our tool.
- Application benchmarks (LU, IS, BT)
  - currently only BT works fine
  - Consider N-body, LU
  - integrate into this repo: "examples" folder
- Ideally: these are confirmed across more than one architecture. But it's
  fine if we limit ourselvs to intel architectures.
- For each benchmark and architecture, have a markdown file or
  something that walks the user through what they should expect. For
  example...
  - This one program we have uses x and should be bottlenecked by FMAs
  - so we expect some memory bandwidth but mostly flops, with ports 0 and 1
    saturated
  - here's the picture we expect
  - I'm envisioning one markdown file per benchmark, and then in each
    markdown file we mention some of the differences we expect across
    architectures

## By May 1 (but start now) - How does the next person to work on this pick it up and move forward?

- Make it so they can reproduce my results
- Write some documentation for them
  - about the tool itself
    - because we sample, it's possible there are artifacts from that. For
      example, if you only measure flops when flops are heavily used and
      then only measure bw when bw is loaded, your program will appear more
      saturated than it actually is.
  - about performance counters in general, what's challenging about them
    - Hardware: we only have n performance counters
    - Software: if you want to measure bandwidth, you don't have ajust a
      "bandwidth" counter, this has to be interpreted
- documentation:
  - for high-level things, text files are fine
  - for tool-level things, comment on functions. Consider doxygen?
  - Plan some next steps for them

## By May 12 - use this tool to gain insight on one real application

- hopefully a graph problem
- consider 'page rank' or
  ['space-time kernel density (stkd)'](https://webpages.uncc.edu/~esaule/public-website/papers/icpp17-SPHTD.pdf)

## By June 30 - Deploy v1.0.0

- name the tool: "Global Picture"? "fhv"?
- "global picture" is what Dr. Saule called it on the NSF grant

# Notes per week
Following are my notes for each week of development.

# 2021-06-18 through 2021-06-24

## Goals:
### Priority
- [ ] "UOPS_EXECUTED..." rather than "UOPS_DISPATCHED"
  - [ ] check likwid to see what is most commonly used
- [ ] documentation on how to add different architectures
- [ ] bandwidth microbenchmarks

### Other
- [ ] document convolution/polynomial expansion
- [ ] document "interpreting results"
- [ ] include instructions on reproducing results for
  - [ ] microbenchmarks
  - [ ] application benchmarks
- [ ] improved documentation: 
  - [x] mention that if you don't do `make install` make sure to run `make
    perfgroups`
  - [x] mention in the documentation to check out a specific tag (v5.1.1)
  - [ ] using likwid-perfctr cli to explore counters
  - [ ] "interpreting results": mention what saturation is and how values are
    calculated
    - saturation: observed performance / expected maximum from benchmark
- [ ] change error to warning on vectorization ratio
- [ ] tell people to use `benchmark.sh | tee benchmark-output.log`
- [x] cache sizes in `benchmark.sh` are hard-coded. Try to get them
  automatically (likwid-topology | grep ...)
- [ ] re-enable RAM on BroadwellEP
- [ ] demo on real-world app
- [ ] automate benchmark

## Accomplishments:
- dramatically improved benchmark
- unfortunately, likwid does seem to have a 50/50 split of whether it uses
  UOPS_DISPATCHED* or UOPS_EXECUTED*.... what's worse, skylake has DISPATCHED but not EXECUTED and broadwell has EXECUTED but not DISPATCHED
  - this will have to be handled on a per-architecture basis
  - remember to include documentation on adding an architecture

## Would be nice, but lower priority
- demo on a real-world application
- automatic benchmark

# 2021-06-10 through 2021-06-17

## Accomplishments:
- Wrote a lot of documentation
  - see new `./docs` folder. 
  - `installation` and `usage` are the most complete
  - next I'd like to write `interpreting-results`, as that seems important.
- should work on broadwell (though untested!)
- [x] let's improve usability: 
  - [x] config file for architecture info
- [ ] finish microbenchmarks (bandwidth!)
  - [x] move sp benchmark to own file
  - [ ] move dp benchmark to own file
  - [ ] create L2 bw benchmark
  - [ ] update benchmark script automatically populates config file

## Questions
- transfer ownership of repository? Or just give you admin rights to my repo?
  - Not sure yet.... We'll come back to that next week
- can you test on broadwell, or should I reserve time on chameleon cloud?
  - Dr. Saule has set aside time next week to try to get things working.
- one of our goals was demonstrating the soundness of this application with
  some applications that are well-understood. I wrote code to demo this with
  convolution and polynomial expansion last summer and fall, are these
  adequate?
  - good start for application benchmarks
  - with both these applications they will move from compute bound to memory
    bound depending on parameters
  - write documentation on this

## My thoughts on next steps
- Confirming soundness of tool:
  - test on another architecture
  - write some documentation about what to expect
  - should I finish microbenchmarks for memory and cache? 
  - how should we approach application benchmarks?
- documentation/usability/make it easy on the next person
  - interpreting results
  - I'd like to make the benchmark process automatic. This won't be hard after
    finishing microbenchmarks, but it will still take a day or two that could
    be spent on other things.
- gain insight into one real application
  - I don't think we're ready, let's address the points above first

# 2021-04-30 through 2021-05-07
## Goals
- document the usage
  - and then let Erik know
- get it working on broadwell
- document benchmark process
- add bandwidth benchmark comparison

### Other notes on goals
- we are behind
  - start documentation
  - priority: finish verifying validity of tool
  - one real application? Or another architecture?
    - erik: "real live application" is probably more important, but
      demonstrating real-world applicability will probably require us to use a
      different architecture
    - the other architecture should probably be broadwell: this is Erik's
      machine
- documentation:
  - documentation on how to do it, give it to Erik to see how someone who is
    less familiar with the code can handle usage
  - install tool
  - integrate to application
  - how to configure results
  - how to inerpret results
- benchmark for setup
  - I'd like to automate benchmark process, but that's less important for now.
  - Document how to benchmark and where to put the results (architecture.hpp)

# 2021-04-21 through 2021-04-30
## Goals
- figure out the discrepancies between fhv and manual measurement

## Accomplishments
- number of flops: 
  - was not considering that flops are counted only one in seven iterations, so
    we must multiply final value by 7
  - "FP_ARITH_INST_RETIRED_256B_PACKED_DOUBLE" counts both the multiply and 
    add part of FMA, so you should NOT multiply that value by 2
  - these two factors brought difference down to under 0.25% in all cases 
    except the first and last iteration
  - last iteration is still 30% error for number of flops, which is bad
  - but this is probably because the fhv version only runs 7 times, whereas the
    manual version runs 10 times. That would explain it.
  - after fixing this problem, error was under 1% about half the time, and the
    other half of the time it was around 5%
- update on other discrepancies:
  - did me being on call make a difference? YES! flop rate difference went down
    to about 1%
  - does 'vmovaps' count as a float?
    - no! at least not the floats we care about. See results:
    - Counter value for FP_ARITH_INST_RETIRED_256B_PACKED_SINGLE:
          with 15 vmovaps, 1  vfmadd: 148571400.0000 
          with 1  vmovaps, 1  vfmadd: 148571400.0000
          with 1  vmovaps, 15 vfmadd: 2228570800.0000
          with 15 vmovaps, 15 vfmadd: 2228570800.0000
  - does counting each thread individually make a difference?
    - this reduced the error but did not eliminate it

# 2021-04-07 through 2021-04-21
## Questions:
- Should we re-prioritize? I see we're behind on our goals
  - IMO microbenchmarks are most important
  - I can start documentation?
- Getting dramatically different results in FHV and in manual measurement
  - some notable files:
  - summary: https://github.com/paigeweber13/fine-hardware-visualization/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks/comparison-results.csv
  - more detail: https://github.com/paigeweber13/fine-hardware-visualization/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks/data/peakflops_sp_avx_fma_fhv_parallel_1000000000_10.json
  - source code: https://github.com/paigeweber13/fine-hardware-visualization/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks/main.cpp

## Accomplishments
- fhv now accepts multiple files for input to visualization
  - easy to visualize many jsons at once
- microbenchmark "peakflops_sp_avx_fma" is measured manually and with fhv
- discovered that our tool does not do well with single core performance:
  - port usage seems completely incorrect

## TODO:
- [ ] give likwid a .gitignore, create pull request
- [x] add parallel fhv measuring to peakflops_sp_avx_fma
- [ ] analyze results: is our tool telling us what we expect?
  - [ ] figure out why fhv and manual results are so different
- [ ] add other microbenchmarks

# 2021-03-24 through 2021-04-07

## Accomplishments
- called assembly code from C++!
  - needed `extern "C" void <funcname>()`, why was "C" necessary?
  - with size above ~10,000 doubles, I get a segfault. Why?
- manually timed peakflops_sp_avx_fma

## Notes from Meeting
- why the limit on array size?
- why "extern "C" void ..."
  - C convention only tracks function name in table of symbols
  - C++ also tracks types of inputs and outputs
- use "objdump" to view symbol table
- SEGFAULT
  - peakflops code *may* be pushing things to stack
  - allocation may not work? but that seems less likely. you could try it with
    malloc though.
  - values may need to be a multiple of something special, like 64?


# 2021-03-17 through 2021-03-24

## Goals

- [ ] meter likwid benchmarks with our tool
  - [x] add likwid as a submodule to `./tests/microbenchmarks/likwid`
  - [x] create own makefile that will rely on likwid's makefile to produce
        assembly
  - [ ] run likwid benchmarks from own code
  - [ ] write own code that will meter assembly, both manually (simple
        runtime, then calculate flops) and with fhv
- [ ] fix likwid_minimal with cli
- [ ] figure out what likwid_api_minimal is for?

## Accomplishments

- spent about 3 hours with likwid-bench trying to see if we could just insert
  fhv measuring. I don't think it's feasible, instead I'll write a separate
  framework to wrap the assembly.
- the reason you were getting lower flops than expected last week is because
  `peakflops_avx` does NOT use fma. You have to run `peakflops_avx_fma` for
  that.
- cleaned out old tests

## Notes from meeting
- Ok to use OpenMP?
  - yes
  - use a barrier
  - time from the barrier to the outside of the section
- STREAMs in switch statements are parameters
  - have multiple because you will not always have exactly one input and one
    output
  - STREAM_2 is for a fucntion with 2 parameters
  - testcase.h has all the test definitions using the `TestCase` struct
- daxpy: double vector add (as + y)
- if you initialize a struct with `{}` any parameters you leave off get
  initialized to zero

## Notable changes from this week:

- `./examples/minimal/`
- `./tests/microbenchmarks/`

## Discoveries about likwid-benchmark

- unless otherwise specified, all paths assume the likwid repository as root
- make generates `./bench/GCC/testcases.h`, which has the names of the test
  cases and the kernels used in the switch statment found in
  `./bench/src/bench.c`
- each architecture has its own folder within `./bench`. These contain
  hand-written `.ptt` files which define the benchmarks.
- Assembly is generated from these `.ptt` files, ~~but I believe it's only for
  inspection. I don't believed they somehow linked it into C code.~~ (I later
  discovered that the assembly is converted into object files with `as`, the
  GNU assembler. This is aboslutely bonkers.)
- The makefile at `./bench/makefile` has rules which create `.pas` files from
  `.ptt`, and then `.o` files from the `.pas` files. These rules are at line
  123 and 128 at the time of writing.
  - The `.pas` files are generated with a perl script located at
    `./bench/perl/generatePas.pl`
  - `.pas` is the extension for pascal files, but the content does not seem to
    be in the pascal language? I'm not sure, I have only looked at a couple of
    samples of pascal before.
  - This is definitely not pascal. The file `./bench/perl/AsmGen.pl` begins
    with a comment that describes itself as "Parser for internal high level
    assembly syntax". The grammar for this syntax is described in the variable `$main::grammar` found in the file `./bench/perl/AsmGen.pl`
  - To convert the `.pas` files into object files, the makefile first uses the
    perl script `./bench/perl/AsmGen.pl` to generate assembly.
  - Then, the program `as` (the GNU assembler) is used to produce object files
    from this assembly code.
- `./bench/src/bench.c` defines and uses the macro `MEASURE()`. Whatever
  they're measuring is probably what we want to measure.
- `./bench/src/bench.c` contains a function `runTest()` which actually runs the
  test. This is run on multiple threads. Notice that it uses `likwid_pinThread`
  to pin threads and then outputs information about the thread it's running on.
- this function, `runTest()` is run by `./bench/src/threads.c:threads_create`,
  which uses `pthread_create` to run it

## Questions

# 2021-03-10 through 2021-03-17

## Goals

- [ ] Investigate stream/alternatives
  - [ ] is stream vectorizing?
  - [ ] is stream using good OMP schedule?
  - [ ] What about LIKWID benchmarks?
- [ ] look at flops_sp and flops_dp benchmarks, are they adequate?
- [ ] Measure a microbenchmark for BW using FHV, compare results with
      benchmark's results
- [ ] generate `svg`s before and after each drop in band width when we move
      from L1 to L2 and such
- [ ] for whatever benchmark we use, consider generating x/y chart of parameter
      size and bandwidth
- [ ] ensure I still have access to chameleon cloud

### If time permits:

- investigate a latency benchmark
- Consider how latency is affected by TLB:
  - if you access [TLB SIZE] of contiguous memory while measuring latency,
    you'll get a good low value
  - but if you artificially scatter teh same size's worth of data across
    memory, you'll get a much higher latecny value because of walking the TLB
- investigate an integer arithmetic benchmark
- double-confirm computer bandwidth as given by benchmark by using another
  benchmark program

## Accomplishments

### Investigated STREAM

- STREAM issues a warning when trying to measure sizes that will fit in L1
  cache:
  ```
  Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
  Each test below will take on the order of 3 microseconds.
     (= 3 clock ticks)
  Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
  you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.
  ```

## Questions

- been struggling, only reason I got anything done this week is I had a flash
  of energy on Tuesday and worked all day
- spend some time talking about difference in architecture: Dr. Saule was
  curious about this

## Notes from meeting

# 2021-03-03 through 2021-03-10

## Notes from meeting

- STREAM benchmark
  - need to play to get compiler to vectorize
  - need to play with omp scheduling
  - you _CAN_ use it for cache sizes
- getting a benchmark to determine saturation
  - anything reasonable is probably good, as long as we're not like off by 50% we should be good
  - I could spend months just trying to drill down into why I'm not getting the data I expect

## Accomplishments

- investigated STREAM
  - some PRs on a github mirror
  - doesn't seem to be suitable for measuring cache bandwidth?
    - the `stream.c` file insists on making the amount of memory allocated at
      least 4x the size of the largest cache.
    - I want to compare this to the likwid microbenchmarks

## Questions

- spend some time talking about difference in architecture: Dr. Saule was
  curious about this

## Goals

- [ ] decide what microbenchmarks we're gonna use
- [ ] confirm results with FHV/global picture tool
- [ ] double-confirm with a second microbenchmark suite?
- [ ] Confirm still ahve access to chameleon cloud

### Some more detail on those goals:

- look at what benchmark we're gonna do
  - BW - STREAM
  - Latencies
    - TLB
  - basic vector flops - FMA and such, with single/double precision
    - can probably use hand-written. Consider likwid benchmarks
  - integer arithmetic
- Confirm
  - make sure they run the way we expect (use another tool, not FHV)
  - then confirm results with FHV
- STREAM
  - scale - copy with a fixed integer multiply
  - copy is copy
  - (NO READ BW)
  - add is vector add
  - Triad: FMA
- Look at likwid benchmarks
- Experiment, then come to Dr. Saule with results
  - have a report for next week
- Low priority: compare with second microbenchmark suite?

# 2021-02-24 through 2021-03-03

## Accomplishments

- Skimmed your paper on kernel density
- downloaded stream code and began to read it
  - stream benchmark gives fastest bw values for very small sizes, this is to be expected right? Because it will all fit in L1?
- looked at what likwid groups are available
- fiddled with kerncraft

## Questions

- What's a focused goal or two I can have for this week? Felt pretty purposeless this last week, like I was just filling time
- would it be useful to create a graph with stream

## Goals

- documentation is on back burner
- demonstrating soundness, repeatibility: goal is to finish within 4-6 weeks
- after that, testing tool on new programs

For this week:

- [ ] better BW benchmark
- [ ] choose next application benchmark: LU? N-body?
- [ ] look at what likwid groups are available for other architectures

# 2021-02-17 through 2021-02-24

## Goals

- [x] Further investigate why port usage seems low
- [x] if we can't accurately predict theoretical benchmarks, is an experiential
      benchmark adequate?
  - [x] revisit Kerncraft: do they generate an estimate for expected
        performance? - they don't. They require you to add theoretical values.
- [ ] Learn about LU NPB
- [ ] Look at what groups are available for different intel architectures
- [ ] Do you think unit testing should be part of the plan to pass this off?
  - [ ] Honestly, I'm not even sure we know what results to expect yet

## Accomplishments

- The way I measure port usage is definitely wrong
  - summed to about 0.5 in the 2 cases I checked
  - FIXED: Port usage was low because I was forgetting to re-initialize the
    counters to 0 between (thread, region) pairs. See
    `src/fhv_perfmon.cpp:calculate_saturation()`
- Some findings about kerncraft:
  - you have to input number of flops per cycle and other performance metrics
    like that
  - I used [this machine file](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/kerncraft/blob/master/examples/machine-files/SkylakeSP_Gold-5122.yml)
    as a starting place and began to adapt it to my machine

## Questions

- Can we set a time map together
- At what point should I start documenting everything? Should I begin to add
  documentation to a couple functions every week? Or wait til we're closer to
  the end of my time?
  - documentation of tool itself, usage
  - explain how performance counters work, what's challenging about them
    - Hardware: we only have n performance counters
    - Software: if you want to measure bandwidth, you don't have ajust a
      "bandwidth" counter, this has to be interpreted
      - because we sample, it's possible there are artifacts from that. For
        example, if you only measure flops when flops are heavily used and
        then only measure bw when bw is loaded, your program will appear more
        saturated than it actually is.
- documentation:
  - for high-level things, text files are fine
  - for tool-level things, comment on functions. Consider doxygen?

# New Year! 2021-01-20 through 2021-01-02-17

## Goals

- benchmark flops and create diagram of flops benchmark performance
  - are we misinterpreting the meaning of sums/means and when each should be
    used?
- benchmark what I have for mem/cache
- finish metering LU
- look at IS again, don't spend too much time on it though

## Accomplishments

- Added parameter string to benchmarks
- Metered flops benchmarks (see `tests/data/benchmark_flops_*.json`)
  - also metered cache/mem
- Investigated current state of how we calculate things:
  - port usage is a geometric mean
  - everything else is a 'saturation' which is calculated in
    'fhv_perfmon::calculate_saturation' and uses the 'sum' of flops and
    bandwidth measures divided by the sum of the associated benchmark measures
- made visualization work even if there is data missing
- re-ran flops benchmarks while measuring all groups needed for a good diagram
- over the break, learned a lot about C++ build systems and TDD
  - spend a little bit of time trying to get CMake for our project, as it seems
    WAY easier than make
  - also TDD is amazing and I'd like to start adding features through TDD (but
    I won't go back and add tests for existing code unless you ask)
- added 'make exports' and 'make devexports' rules to makefile for convenience

## Questions

- What does the measurement of the flops benchmark tell you? to mee it seems
  as we expect, with ports 0 and 1 highly saturated.
- Feeling like I don't have much of a direction: what's the vision for this
  semester?
  - I know the next few steps, but I want to have something in mind that I'm
    working towards
  - Apply to graph problems?
- How much do you want me to worry about making this code readable and well
  documented for whoever comes after me?
  - is testing important for whomever comes later?
- Codebase feels really messy, in general things feel unstable.
  - First time I tried to run the flops benchmark and meter it, got "WARN:
    Skipping region region*flops_sp-0 for evaluation." Which seems to just *keep
    coming back\*. I thought we had this all worked out after I spent a month
    working with Tom to figure out stability issues.
  - Any recommendations?

# 2020-12-09 through 2020-12-16

## Goals

- benchmark flops and create diagram of flops benchmark performance
  - are we misinterpreting the meaning of sums/means and when each should be used?
- finish metering LU
- look at IS again, don't spend too much time on it though

## Questions

- can we go over IS?

# 2020-12-02 through 2020-12-09

## Goals

- [ ] instrument
  - [ ] LU
    - [ ] almost done! Still need to fix l2norm only measuring some groups
  - [ ] IS
- [ ] generate diagrams
  - [ ] LU
  - [ ] IS

## Accomplishments

- Instrumented LU
- Looked at IS

## Questions

- Once I switched IS to g++, it would only run on CLASS=S
  - can you try to get it working with c++?
- can you look at LU and tell me if you think it makes sense?
  - I remember you said mostly dense linear algebra
  - I haven't looked at it yet because I'm trying to work out the kinks of
    measurement
- notes from meeting on LU:
  - mostly memory bound
  - there's some high port usage on ports 0, 1 in all_computation but we don't
    see that in any of the sub-groups
  - the matrices get smaller as execution continues: are later groups measuring
    smaller matrices?
    - When the benchmark reports flops it multiplies by `itmax`, so we can be
      fairly sure that each iteration is about the same execution time

# 2020-11-18 through 2020-12-02

## Goals

- [x] write discrete color scale
- [x] add discrete color scale to performance visualization
- [x] play with log scale to tune what goes into each bin
- [x] generate diagrams for BT

## Accomplishments

- JSONs and SVGs now contain hardware info automatically. This information is
  gathered when "resultsToJson" is called, which should always happen on the
  same machine that does the computation, even in cases like clusters that have
  head nodes and worker nodes.
- wrote discrete color scale, and it looks great. For instance, compare [the
  original interpolated purple-blue
  scale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/fine-hardware-visualization/0acea0827c9dc5be73279ee05998edb24b38100c/visualizations/swatches/interpolated-continuous-scale/colorbrewer-255%2C247%2C251_to_2%2C56%2C88.svg)
  to the [new, discrete purple-blue
  scale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/fine-hardware-visualization/c4e49a8d3c486340139476e9f5419f8cf29bcee4/visualizations/swatches/discrete-scale/PuBu.svg).
  The new scale is much less muddy and does a better job conveying the different
  levels.
- created an [image demonstrating each
  scale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/fine-hardware-visualization/bca16bf665a8724f49f02aae4fc2d6e833f84fb1/visualizations/swatches/all_discrete_scales.svg).
  In my opinion, many of these look better than the purple-blue scale. My
  favorites are the red-purple and yellow-green, which are in the 3rd and 4th
  rows, respectively.
- visualization now uses discrete color scale. You can find a [bunch of
  examples here](https://github.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/tree/bc52ae1269c5841b6ccda50bb17f6d24824500df/data/bt.A)
  - to compare each scale, check out these:
    - [PuBu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/bc52ae1269c5841b6ccda50bb17f6d24824500df/data/bt.A/bt.A_PuBu_add.svg)
    - [RdPu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/bc52ae1269c5841b6ccda50bb17f6d24824500df/data/bt.A/bt.A_RdPu_add.svg)
    - [YlGn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/bc52ae1269c5841b6ccda50bb17f6d24824500df/data/bt.A/bt.A_YlGn_add.svg)
    - [YlGnBu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/bc52ae1269c5841b6ccda50bb17f6d24824500df/data/bt.A/bt.A_YlGnBu_add.svg)
    - [Greys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/bc52ae1269c5841b6ccda50bb17f6d24824500df/data/bt.A/bt.A_Greys_add.svg)
  - my favorites are "YlGnBu" and "RdPu"
  - Erik's favorite is "RdPu"

## Questions

- Thoughts on color scales? Do you have a favorite we should use for the
  default? (there's a CLI parameter to select the scale)
- Thoughts on log scale? I feel like it's decent...
  - [Here's a graph of the exact scale we use](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rgfdtyk7x9)
  - yeah, good enough for now
- Could you guide me on metering LU and IS?
  - notes from meeting in TODO

# 2020-11-04 through 2020-11-11

## Goals for this week

- write discrete color scale
  - play with log scaling to tune what gets put in each bin
- test that scale
  - generate some swatches
  - generate some diagrams with a few color options

# 2020-10-28 through 2020-11-04

Reminder from Dr. Saule: the big goal is to see how execution changes over
time, and one of the best examples of problems whose needs change over
time is graph problems.

Some examples of irregular graphs are:

- [wikitalk](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/SNAP/wiki-Talk.png)
- [enron emails](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/SNAP/email-Enron.png)
- [CIT patents](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/SNAP/cit-Patents.png)

A more regular example is [this boeing matrix](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/Boeing/pwtk.png)

All of these examples are from [the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu/)

## Accomplishments

- worked with KRS on visualization
  - "So the interpolated plots might seem nice and continuous, but discrete
    colors will give you better discrimination that users can perceive better."
  - also recommended "stacked time varying plots that change as the execution
    progresses" - perhaps something like
    [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/81KbD.png), where each color would be a
    different hardware resource?
  - another option is Sankey diagrams
  - both of these require data as a function of time
- looked at likwid docs with Tom
- set up new dev machine

## Questions

- thoughts on stacked line plot?
  - how difficult would it be to measure over time?
    - naive way is to separate computation into several functions and meter
      them separately.
    - we will likely want to do something like sampling eventually, but this
      isn't urgent.
- any adjustments to my goals for this week?

# 2020-10-21 through 2020-10-28

## Accomplishments

- gave Tom some feedback on the likwid docs
- played with visualization
  - talking with KRS, but we're still in the process of working on it. His
    only recommendation so far is to use Color Brewer, which we have.

## Goals for this week

- spend some time setting up new development desktop
- little bit of software engineering (should take a day's work max)
- continue metering NAS parallel benchmarks do vTune or FHV with LU

## Questions

- What are your thoughts on the swatches I created?
  - "catastrophically bad": 128%2C128%2C128_to_43%2C140%2C190.svg
  - bad: 128%2C128%2C128_to_43%2C140%2C190.svg
  - bad: 128%2C128%2C128_to_227%2C74%2C51.svg
  - grayscale might be easiest
  - two-color scale might be nice
  - Next steps: use d3 to help us identify some color schemes.
    - methods of interpolation?
    - multipoint interpolation
    - hue interpolation
  - discrete color scale
    - pick a compule color scales
    - generate saturation diagrams
    - try linear an dlog scales
- Worth it to spend some time with vTune on BT before moving on to LU? Just
  go ahead with LU for now?
  - just go ahead with 2 more kernels in fhv: LU and IS
- How do I resolve the "relocation truncated to fit" issue?
  - do we even need to worry abou the biggest problem class?

# 2020-10-14 through 2020-10-21

## Accomplishments

- all commits working on NPB-C are on the branch "add-fhv-measuring", which
  is available here:
  https://github.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/tree/add-fhv-measuring
- got BT to work with FHV measuring. Following are some stats:
  - | class | Time to run (s) |
    | ----- | --------------- |
    | S     | 0.36            |
    | W     | 3.21            |
    | A     | 46.92           |
    | B     | 196.61          |
    | C     |
- when compiling for size C, size of compiled program would include code
  past the 5GiB mark, which is outside the 32-bit addressable memory space.
  - ```
    [BT] size --common bt.o
       text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
     128591	     24	5082349889	5082478504	12ef077a8	bt.o
    ```
  - get "relocation truncated to fit" when attempting to link
  - tried adding `-mcmodel=large` to compile command, to no avail.
  - tried adding `-march=native`
  - tried adding `-O0`
- while creating visualizations for NPB, discovered some problems with file
  I/O and error handling
  - made `fhv` automatically create directories if needed when outputting svg
    diagrams
  - made `fhv` give error that json was missing when not found instead of
    letting the error be handled by nlohmann/json, which gives an unclear
    message
  - some example commands to test:
    to create json: `FHV_OUTPUT=data/TEST/bt.W.json LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/likwid-master/lib:~/code/fine-hardware-visualization/build/lib bin/bt.W`
    to create visualization: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/likwid-master/lib:~/code/fine-hardware-visualization/build/lib ~/code/fine-hardware-visualization/build/bin/fhv -v data/TEST/bt.W.json -o data/TEST_SVG/bt.W.svg`
  - moved some globals from `fhv_perfmon` to `types` and `utils`
- made some diagrams for bencmark bt! You can see them [here](https://github.com/rileyweber13/NPB3.0-omp-C/tree/add-fhv-measuring/data/bt.A)
  - tri-diagonal solver
  - adi_all diagram seems to make sense.
    - Port 5 and 6 are integer operations, and it makes sense that we'd see
      less of those
    - makes sense that we wouldn't have double precision floats
    - "probably about as many flops as memory operations"
    - most traffic is at RAM level
  - add also makes sense
- in general, the DATA seems coherent, just the colors can be hard to read
- seems like everything is RAM bound
  - if problem is CPU-bound, it's probably solved
  - therefore it's not interesting and so everything interesting we view is
    RAM-bound
- color scales: try a few different ones
  - grayscale: black to white
  - pick some color scales to demo to Dr. Saule
  - play around with log scale too
    - "progession" is an issue
    - maybe in the case of "add", a linear scale would have been better
  - Talk to KRS about colors
- Look at LU next! We expect them to be more CPU bound, as they are dense
  linear algebra solvers
- maybe look at IS to. Lots of random memory accesses is the expectation

## Questions

- measuring with vTune
  - good to still continue on laptop? or should I just use laptop for dev and then use chameleon
    - difference in machines could matter...
      - More cores = more L3 cache
      - teasing out the differences this makes will require careful understanding of how we generate diagram and what the benchmark does
      - bandwidth to processor speed ration will also change (flop to bandwidth ratio)
    - add something to JSON with basic hardware info

# 2020-10-07 through 2020-10-14

## Accomplishments

- much improved build process, began adding fhv metering to the BT benchmark
- added FHV stuff to `make.def` in the NPB3.0-omp-C repository
- found out I still cant enter hours? Emailed Linda and cc'd you

## Questions

- we will need to either get NPB to compile with g++ or get fhv to work in C...
  - probably easier to get NPB to compile with g++
- seems like everything is written in C: likwid, NPB, etc... are we losing
  anything by requiring C++? Will we have to port this program to C someday?
  - C is highly standardized: easy to interface with other languages
  - we may need this someday but
- Tom (of likwid) has enlisted my help improving the likwid documentation. Do
  you think this is a valuable use of my research hours? Should I spend a
  couple hours per week working on their documentation?
  - honestly I'm not super interested in it... but I'm wondering if it's
    worth doing anyways

# 2020-09-30 through 2020-10-07

## Accomplishments

- Got HR issue worked out, clear to work again
- had to reinstall linux due to many issues I was having (most notably, unable
  to `startx` or start desktop environment
- Started getting fhv and NPB to compile again

# 2020-08-18 through 2020-08-30

## Questions

- is it valuable to have a miss rate? (would be easy to implement for L2, L3.
  unclear how difficult it would be for L1)
  - speaking of L1, the more I learn about CPU (and GPU) architecture, the more
    confused I get on what exactly it is.... Seems more closely tied to core
    than other caches, especially since I and D are separate... also, likwid
    doesn't seem able to directly measure L1 bandwidth.
- C port of NAS benchmarks adequate?
- seems like all performance monitoring tools are written in C. Will we need to
  port this tool to C eventually?

## Accomplishments

- as I was adding separate load/store to diagram, noticed benchmarks were poor:
  some of the test cases we were using performed better than the benchmark
- tinkered with benchmark to improve performance
- ended up using likwid-bench
- likwid-bench broke for bandwidth tests too large for any cache (meant to test
  RAM bw)
- looked into NAS parallel benchmarks
  - 90% are in fortran
  - [found a C port](https://github.com/benchmark-subsetting/NPB3.0-omp-C) that
    seems to be pretty good
    - Dr. Saule knows the person who wrote this: it's a student of the person
      who taught Dr. Saule computer architecture
- began changing makefile to produce shared library for easy inclusion at
  compile time (for measuring nas parallel benchmarks)
- finished converting build chain to produce and use a shared library

How do we measure NAS parallel benchmarks using our program?

- source code will have `#ifdef FHV_PERFMON ... #endif` sections
- how to compile?
  - in make.def, include fhv stuff and add -DFHV_PERFMON flag?
  - add `PERFMON=` variable, to be specified when make is run, that will
    automatically include things and add flag?

# 2020-08-11 through 2020-08-18

## Questions

- what is our goal to finish before end of summer?
- is Instruction Cache important to visualize? Only metrics likwid provides
  are:
  - L1I request rate = ICACHE_ACCESSES / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
  - L1I miss rate = ICACHE_MISSES / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
  - L1I stall rate = ICACHE_IFETCH_STALL / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
  - L1I miss ratio = ICACHE_MISSES / ICACHE_ACCESSES
  - would be easy to create ratios for stalls as well
- Is visualizing slots in a vector an upcoming goal?
- For now at least, is average execution conditions across entire run of a
  program adequate? Eventually, we'll want to have short samples so we can see
  how execution changes, correct?
- what do you think about using machine learning to gain insights into the
  immense number of performance counters available to us?
  - I don't think our final project has a need for machine learning, but maybe
    during the research process it could give us some insights into what
    counters and metrics are important. Thoughts?
  - It can find patterns while sorting through huge amounts of data, which is
    something I've been struggling to do as I examine even just the perfgropus
    supplied by likwid (which is a small subset of the total number of
    performance counters supplied by intel)

Not related to this project

- Do you know any professors that teach web development who would be willing to
  answer some questions for me? I'm working on a side project that will involve
  building a webapp
- What OS do supercomputer clusters use? CentOS? RHEL? OpenSUSE?

## Accomplishments

- started restructuring diagram to fit overview with more detailed in-core
  performance
- began adding new counters that will be used in the detailed overview diagram
- Thinking about config files. This is for the future, not to be implemented
  now. However, this may affect how some things surrounding config are built
  - architecture: will be hand written or generated by fhv. Not intended to be
    edited by end-user
    - hard part is it's nice to have a list of the key words for port usage
      events and the port usage metrics we use. This makes it easy to identify
      those results in per_thread_results as well as find the aggregate ratios
      fhv creates in aggregate_results. This can be created dynamically using
      port_nums, but this requires some code to run, and when to run that code
      is a complicated question. Because then we can't use
      performance_monitor_defines unless we add some kind of init function or
      something.
    - let's have architecture config also include key_metrics,
      port_usage_metrics, and the like. For now, will be hard-coded. May be
      automatically generated later.
  - diagram: configures size of things in diagram. May be edited by end-user,
    but there may not even be a need for that
- Consider
  [this](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-cookbook/top/tuning-recipes/poor-port-utilization.html):
  what does it mean to have "Vector capacity Usage" at 100%? if we have one
  full sized AVX vector operation, does the counter immediately jump to 100%?

### Intel TMA method

- Seems to be showing latency, not bandwidth
- multiple instructions could be waiting on the same memory operation
- perhaps more abstract than what we are going for? Perhaps we want something more low-level, more raw?
  - In TMA, if an add is stalled by memory, the memory will be highlighted.
  - In our application, if an add is stalled, the add ports will be highlighted
- Retired instructions still contribute to usage, latency, etc. However, they're kind of ignored...

### Intel vTune

- Do MUL and FMA count the same?
- as soon as you put in one vector operation, does Vector Capacity Usage jump to 100%?

### General

- "a lot of the tools I've seen are hard to use, interface with, and understand"
- as long as what we do is easy to use, it's okay if we don't let people see everything
  - we want to show people as their code is executing like maybe at first there's a lot of I/O so that flashes, but then there's computation and so that flashes.
  - Quick overview for experienced programmers
  - intro to architecture (maybe even in CS 1) for new students
- "the closwer we are to the actualy architecture, the harder it is to see where the load is"
- someday it may be useful to bake in expectations. Have the user say "this is what I expect my application to do. If it doesn't do this, tell me"
  - For instance, "I expect my application to be flop bound and do 20 million flops" so if it does 20 billion flops, we know something is wrong

## Next steps

- Finish adjusting diagram to be a detailed overview
- Add load/store benchmarks
- Add load/store saturation
- Gather a set of simple test applications
  - NAS parallel benchmarks
- Using these tests, compare our application to intel vTune

# Biggest questions, main points

- How will we do per-core saturation measurements? How will we average them for
  the overviews?
  - How should we get a benchmark for single-thread performance in key areas?
    Should we run one thread alone? Run all threads and take the average?
    - what about Memory, where only one thread reports metrics?
  - Will we average "saturation" for multiple performance measurements (e.g.
    portion back-end bound, decoding rate, etc) for the overall saturation?
  - ANSWERS:
    - shared resources, like caches and memory, necessitate averages. It might
      not even make sense to do per-core measurements for these resources
      - what if thread 1 only hits because thread 0 missed 100 cycles ago?
- What new counters will we use?
  - Does the Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis method make sense? Does this
    fit the 3 core areas you mentioned weeks ago?
  - What about L2CACHE, L3CACHE, CYCLE_ACTIVITY, ICACHE, etc?
  - What will we benchmark from these groups?
- [Here](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/view/5ac956c3-ac5c-4717-ade2-6b13cec09f26/0_0)
  is a diagram presenting drafts of the visualizations we'll create. How does
  this look? What changes would you make?
- Info on TMA
  - most came from [an intel article](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-cookbook/top/methodologies/top-down-microarchitecture-analysis-method.html)
  - There was also a handy

## Questions

See last week. Additional questions listed here

- one of the key performance groups you mentioned is "micro instruction
  retiring", and one of the ways you explained that was "can you fetch
  instructions quickly enough". What exactly does that mean? Does that mean you
  can fetch operands quickly enough from memory? Does that mean getting new
  instructions from memory? Is this factor unique to the front-end or back-end
  of the processor?
- how does TMA group sound for identifying performance in our 3 key areas?
  - certainly seems to highlight uop decoding and retiring
- as the number of things we want to measure grows, would it make sense to use
  the likwid stethoscope mode?
  - but I know the execution loads can change throughout the execution of a
    program.... Perhaps it makes sense to do many short stethoscope
    measurements across execution?
  - this may be a good way to get a sense for how execution changes as a
    program runs
  - right now we're only showing the average state across entire execution
    anyways
  - this could make a pretty animation
- stethoscope is not really meant for fine-tuned execution. We could hack it to
  do this though? I don't know how we'd trigger it from code
  - what other technologies might allow us to do this?
  - require people to create fine-tuned groups? this is unwieldy

## Accomplishments

- Finished restructuring performance_monitor
- Added numbers to legend
- revisited examples and made them all work again
- some minor work on software engineering in makefiles
- added port usage to saturation diagram
- Identified some counters that we can use to measure 3 key performance areas:
  - TMA!!!
  - CYCLE_ACTIVITY/CYCLE_STALLS: stalls due to L1D misses, L2 misses, and L3
    misses (memory loads) - can help diagnose back-end bound applications
  - L2CACHE, L3CACHE for diagnosing memory issues
  - ICACHE for instruction fetching?
  - UOPS_EXEC/ISSUE/RETIRE might be good if we can understand them...
  - BRANCH for front-end bound?
- feel like a good procedure is:
  1. use TMA to determine front-end/back-end bound
  1. if back-end bound, look at memory (for memory-bound cases) and port-usage
     (for core-bound cases)
     - use counters L2CACHE, L3CACHE, CYCLE_ACTIVITY, etc
  1. if front-end bound, look at code size and branching
  1. if bad-speculation, not really sure what to do. Intel docs recommend
     "compiler techniques such as profile-guided optimization"
  1. if retiring, code is probably good. However, consider if the code is
     retiring non-useful operations. At this point, looking at flops and
     bandwidth may be appropriate

# 2020-07-21 through 2020-07-28

## Questions

Follow up on polynomial expansion

- have you made any progress on investigating polynomial_expansion? Why is
  port4 the most saturated? Why when switching to clang++, port 0 and 1 are the
  most saturated?

These questions all focus on how we should report per-thread saturation

- we're going to do per-thread saturation. I also felt it makes sense to have
  an "overview" that shows an average. Is this useful?
- Several questions on making things per-thread
  - for computation (flop rates, instruction decoding, etc) it's pretty easy to
    create an estimate for the maximum possible rate. However, it gets more
    difficult with memory
  - only one core can control the memory controller... I guess there's no way
    to split up expected bandwidth between four cores, then. Is that right?
    - should we use a counter like "mem_instr_retired" to estimate pressure on
      the memory? That could be done per-core. But then how will we know if
      something will miss the TLB?
  - For L1 and L2 cache, bandwidth varies widely between two threads on the
    same core. If we use both threads, one will have 1.5-2.0x the bandwidth of
    the other.
  - L3 cahce, which is shared by all cores, has similar patterns of variation
    but even greater magnitudes. One thread will report 16 GB/s of bandwidth
    while the other only reports 2 GB/s
- does it make sense to just run a single-threaded benchmark and use that as
  the reference, even though we expect that performance to be much higher than
  all threads are capable of simultaneously?

Miscellaneous questions:

- is creating separate svgs for overview/detailed view a good course of action
  for now?
  - from what I understand, the final goal/vision is to have an interactive
    diagram the user can pan and zoom, right?
  - alternative is to create very small drawings and expect people to zoom into
    the svgs....
- for likwid documentation: does it make sense for me to write documentation
  even though I'm frequently wrong about expected usage? (Thomas and I talked
  for months before I finally learned that likwid_markerNextGroup() must be
  called in a serial region)

Low-priority

- should `#define` or `const` be used? My instinct is `const` because then you
  get type-checking.
- all the performance monitoring tools I've seen are written in C, presumably
  because they are used by C programmers as well as C++ programmers. I seem to
  remember that we decided to use C++ at the beginning. why not C? Do you think
  we'll have to port this to C at some point in the future?

_END OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE STILL UNANSWERED_

---

## Accomplishments

- completely revamped how we process and store results. Things are now much
  easier to work with and much less prone to bugs
- did some research and formed some questions on how we will present per-core
  saturation

# 2020-07-14 through 2020-07-21

## Accomplishments

- [pull request](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/pull/303) for likwid is
  merged!
- dramatically improved draw_diagram function
  - moved to own file so it's not bloating the driver file
  - created reusable functions to keep code DRY
  - switched to pango, a much more powerful text engine that has first-class
    support in cairo
  - made it easy to configure diagram (and easy to move configuration to a
    separate .ini file or similar)
  - began work on a "detail view" that will show us in-core performance with
    finer granularity: things like port saturation

## Next steps

In general, I want to pivot away from maintenance and start adding features. We
can return to code maintenance later.

- implement port usage in "detail view"
- look at counters that will help us identify instruction decoding and
  micro-instruction retiring (key areas identified in the past)
- have the program automatically adapt to new configurations (for now, this
  means different numbers of cores, but same architecture)

## Backlog

- clean up and simplify makefile (goal is to make it easy to maintain,
  uncomplicated)
- make program adapt to other architectures
- improve likwid documentation
  - tom hasn't made it clear how I can help or if my help is even wanted
  - he may create a "todo" list for documentation that I can use
- give examples their own makefiles
- verify tests/examples. Many of them don't work anymore. Decide what should be
  updated and what should be removed

# 2020-07-07 through 2020-07-14

## Questions

Q: at what point should I make a test suite?

A: There are two purposes:

- bug track
- demonstrate how software is intended to be used

There's a tradeoff. you can find bugs faster with a test suite, but then when
code isn't stable you end up breaking your tests all the time

Now is probably not a good time

Q: how should I organize the file tree for this repo? I had main files in a
separate src directory so that more than one main file won't get grabbed by
a wildcard in the makefile

A: separating library and driver file directories as mentioned above makes
sense

Q: do wildcards in the makefile even make sense? Each file has such different
dependencies. Does compilation go faster if I only add the -I, -L, and -l
flags for the files that need those headers and libraries?

A: you can optimize a little bit... but it's not a big amount, and the
carefully-crafted makefile will require a lot of time to maintain

Q: for example code, I thought it'd be good to use the existing makefile in the
root directory, since the compile commands for each example are the same.
does this make sense?

A: yes, but it can get messy if each example doesn't have the same dependencies
(which is nearly always). Instead, consider including the install prefix and
other common choices from another makefile but having separate makefiles for
each example.

Q: how do I keep the makefile DRY and not rewrite the command for each case
in a single example?

A: one option is to test the name of the target, e.g. pick a different command
based on the suffix of the target

    ifeq, ifneq, subst are useful makefile commands to look into

## Accomplishments

A big part of this week was doing work to refactor fhv to make it more readable
and maintainable. This work is found in the branch "make-diagram-own-file"

- switched from cairo's "Toy" text api to pango
- moved all drawing functions to a different file and class,
  "saturation_diagram".
- started moving things to their own functions

I also spent some time working on my pull request to improve likwid's examples.
This was in response to some changes Thomas wanted me to make.

- removed one region registration to demonstrate that it's optional
- removed some unnecessary barriers and improved comments
- made a separate parallel block to demonstrate GET/RESET, which further
  cleaned up the code
- in the example designed to be independent of the likwid-perfctr CLI tool, the
  program now errors and exits if used with CLI tool.

# 2020-06-30 through 2020-07-07

## Questions

- lower priority: questions on cache from last week

## Accomplishments

- double checked new method for calculating port saturation
- put in two PRs for likwid repo!
  - corrected likwid documentation on marker api
  - updated likwid-markerAPI example. Mainly just fixed position of
    LIKWID_MARKER_SWITCH and improved comments
  - rewrote likwid-internalMarkerAPI from scratch
    - more descriptive comments
    - advanced usage
    - nested groups
    - GET, RESET
    - completely independent of likwid-perfctr (sets environment variables and
      analyzes results)
- began adding to likwid doxygen documentation
- improve software engineering in fhv.cpp
  - moved cairo stuff to own file

# 2020-06-16 through 2020-06-30

## Questions

- cache line size is 64 bytes. But on a skylake system we can only use 32
  bytes. Also, vectors are 32 bytes. What if we used the smaller vectors, the
  16 byte vectors? The core would still load 32 bytes because it can't load
  part of a cache line, so it would just discard the other 16 bytes?
  - wikichip says the bandwidth (for L1/L2 loads) is 64B/cycle. Wikichip
    also says L1 and L2 caches are shared between threads on a single core. I
    assume this implies that the 64B/cycle bandwidth is also shared and that
    this accounts for the 32B cache line we really get per thread in L1. Is
    that right?
  - could you make it so that each thread gets 16 bytes so that you use
    everything loaded?
- for UOPS, what's the difference between "executed", "issued", and
  "dispatched"? The intel documentation uses all 3 and they seem to have
  nuances that separate them, but they are not clearly defined. Intel uses the
  word in its own definition.
  - for instance, the description of "UOPS_EXECUTED_PORT.PORT_0" reads "Counts
    the number of cycles in which a uop is dispatched to port 0."
- why do I get such different saturations/port usages between compilers with
  the same flags?
- at what point should I make a test suite?

## Accomplishments

- explored likwid-api. If we do decide to move away from the marker API, I
  think this is what we should choose.
  - see `tests/likwid_api_minimal.c`
  - single-threaded applications with multiple groups do not have the
    unreasonably-high values problem
  - this is not a definitive result: multi-threaded code must still be tested
  - allows us to take advantage of perfgroups (at least the events, I have not
    got metrics to work yet. I believe the problem comes from not having a
    correct runtime)
- workaround discovered for unreasonably large values bug: add `#pragma omp barrier` before call to `likwid_markerNextGroup`
- fhv performance_monitor now ignores large values and warns the user about
  them
- added barriers to fhv performance_monitor calls (seems to improve stability
  of using fhv wrapper)
  - using fhv start/stopRegion and nextGroup: went 410 iterations without
    having any problems. Final iteration showed unreasonably high values.
  - also using fhv init: went 798 iterations before having a problem.
- "stopping non-started region" seems to happen when one thread stops before
  another has started. I suppose regions are not completely thread-independent,
  but the likwid documentation doesn't mention anything about this...
- explored high saturation on port 4 even for CPU-heavy parameters of
  polynomial_block:
  - kept n at 1024 and increased degree from 1e3 to 1e8. In all cases, port4
    was the most saturated. That seems odd; now I wonder if I'm measuring port
    usage correctly...
  - started inspecting assembly. Also used llvm-mca to get some insights.
    Noticed that I was getting different results from llvm-mca if I used clang,
    so I tried to compile polynomial-block with clang. Results follow
    - command used (in both cases, $(CXX) is replaced with g++ or clang++):
      `$(CXX) polynomial_block.cpp -std=c++14 -O3 -fopenmp -march=native
      -mtune=native -I /usr/local/likwid-master/include -I
      /home/riley/code/fine-hardware-visualization/lib -fopenmp
      /home/riley/code/fine-hardware-visualization/obj/performance_monitor.o -L
      /usr/local/likwid-master/lib -llikwid -DFHV_PERFMON -o
      polynomial_block_fhv_perfmon`
    - key parts are the flags `-std=c++14 -O3 -fopenmp -march=native -mtune=native -llikwid -DFHV_PERFMON`
    - g++ version: g++ (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0
    - clang++ version: clang version
      10.0.1-++20200519095410+f79cd71e145-1~exp1~20200519200813.165 Target:
      x86_64-pc-linux-gnu Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /usr/bin
    - Results: (updated with correct port saturation)
      | Compiler | SP Flops | Top Port Saturation | Second Port Saturation |
      | -------- | -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
      | g++ | 5.654e+04| Port 4 @ 0.236 | Port 3 @ 0.180 |
      | clang++ | 7.642e+04| Port 0 @ 0.182 | Port 1 @ 0.180 |
    - in the case of clang++, ports 2/3 were also fairly saturated at 0.169
    - on skylake, we have to read for writeback, so it makes sense that port 2
      and 3 (the ports for loads) are also fairly saturated. In the case of the
      g++ code, both port 2 and 3 were about 0.180
    - this is much more what we expect in the cpu-heavy case. Interesting how
      much the compiler makes a difference even with the same flags
- looked at how we calculate port usage. Summing all port usages should be 1,
  because it's supposed to be usage of 1/total usage. But that isn't the case.
  The sum of them all was around 0.43 or so for both the g++ and clang++
  versions. Why is that?
  - I think it's because I was using UOPS_EXECUTED_CORE, which counts from both
    threads. Evaluating replacements, but UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD looks promising
  - counts were pretty consistent across runs, here is one example:
  - Thread 2
    sum of UOPS*DISPATCHED_PORT_PORT*\*: 2.70143e+08
    UOPS_EXECUTED_CORE: 3.99846e+08
    UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD: 2.01832e+08
    UOPS_ISSUED_ANY: 1.53631e+08
  - none are spot on, UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD is certainly better
- discovered that in many places the documentation is simply wrong. [The
  documentation for the marker
  API](https://rrze-hpc.github.io/likwid/Doxygen/group__MarkerAPI.html#gaeaba86bf606c2f0044ece3600c5657a9)
  says that `likwid_markerNextGroup` should be called in a parallel region.
  Thomas, the lead dev [mentioned in an
  issue](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/issues/292#issuecomment-646493838)
  that `likwid_markerGroup` should be called in a sequential region.
- fixed how we measure port usage: made fhv sum all the uops executed by port
  and then divide each by that sum
- looked at polynomial_block with Dr. Saule and discovered a few things.
  - even with clang, code is producing a lot of move instructions in assembly
  - unroll 64 was too high; need 8 YMM registers for out, 8 YMM registers for
    xtothepowerof, 8 YMM registers for x. In theory x could spill over to stack
    since we're just reading from it after the beginning, but this may not be
    ideal.
    - in any case, since there weren't enough registers it was spilling to the
      stack. Since the stack is on L1 it was still quite fast
  - changing to unroll 32 still had lots of moves. Changing to unroll 16 had
    fewer moves but no longer used fma. This is odd.

# 2020-06-09 through 2020-06-16

We've decided to continue using likwid at this point, but PAPI may prove useful
in the future.

## Questions

- likwid marker API (already using) vs PAPI vs likwid perfmon API
  (lower-level)
  - IMO likwid marker API enables us to focus more on this research instead of
    redoing the works of others, IF we can get the stability issues ironed out
  - The nice thing about PAPI or the likwid perfmon api is that it gives us
    more control. If something goes wrong, we are more likely to be able to
    fix it. This comes at the cost of more work though.
- keep test results in github or somewhere else?
- planned next steps:
  - decide remain with likwid marker API or switch
  - explore port usage and other counters for polynomial_expansion and
    convolution

## Accomplishments

- worked on fixing likwid; spent some time in the codebase with the goal of
  deciding how long it would take to fix everything
  - Likwid's own examples don't work
  - documentation is somewhat limited. There are doxygen-generated docs but
    they aren't always helpful
  - I don't think likwid has some inherent advantage over other tools like
    PAPI or perf_events. I may be able to fix this, but is it a better use of
    time to just use a different tool?
    - LIKWID does do a lot of the work that I'd have to do otherwise with
      PAPI, like timing code and calculating rates like FLOP/s
  - I'm no longer digging through codebase to resolve this issue, but I will
    provide Thomas with any information I can.
  - while looking for alternatives to likwid, discovered a tool called
    [extrae](https://tools.bsc.es/extrae), which uses PAPI. I think PAPI
    requires some serious investigation
  - tried to run likwid_minimal test on chameleon cloud. The unreasonably high
    values problem became much, much more common. I believe this is because
    since there are many threads, it is more likely that any given thread will
    experience this problem
- explored PAPI
  - I think this is something we should seriously consider
  - looked at duplicating existing saturation values and port_usage values
  - High level API was giving me trouble... Specifying multiple events (even
    events I was sure my arch supports) did not work at all. It would just do
    the first event on the list.
    - turns out HL API fails silently if a counter is not available...
  - Low level api makes errors more clear
  - still not able to meter both computation and cache/memory things at the
    same time. Will investigate
    - seems that PAPI binds to a "component" on PAPI_add_event or
      PAPI_assign_eventset_component. See
      https://bitbucket.org/icl/papi/wiki/PAPI-Multiplexing.md
    - solution is to just create two event sets. With multiple eventSets, is
      it even necessary to use multiplexing?
  - I complained a bit about LIKWID's lack of documentation... honestly PAPI
    suffers from the same problem. Had to figure out about eventSets being
    bound to components on my own.
  - next questions:
    - how do I use PAPI on multithreaded sections?
    - how do I use native event sets?
    - how difficult is it to switch event sets in like a for loop or
      something?
      - furthermore, how would this be used if we were to replace likwid
        in fhv?
  - majority of events would be native events, which are difficult to find the
    codes for. There is probably a map function that we can repeatedly use but
    I haven't figured it out yet
  - another benefit of PAPI is that it supports multiplexing, which would
    allow for multiple performance groups to be measured during one run of the
    key code
- explored Chameleon Cloud
  - the [resource browser](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/hardware/) allows
    you to see the information on the hardware you can allocate.
  - Skylake nodes:
    - use Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6126 CPU @ 2.60GHz cpus
    - almost always have 48 threads. One node in UC only has 24.
    - lists ram size as 205084688384. Assuming that is bytes, we're looking at
      205 GB of ram in a node
  - having trouble with likwid...
    - when running likwid_minimal, get the following error:
      `Warning: Counter PMC3 cannot be used if Restricted Transactional Memory feature is enabled and bit 0 of register TSX_FORCE_ABORT is 0. As workaround write 0x1 to TSX_FORCE_ABORT: sudo wrmsr 0x10f 0x1`
    - running the command given (`sudo wrmsr 0x10f 0x1`) does not help
    - FIXED! Had to add the `-a` flag to the command. This flag runs the
      operation on all processors
    - however, still get the same number of DP scalar ops as on my computer,
      so results seem to be coming through just fine?

# 2020-06-02 through 2020-06-09

- wrote tests to experiment on polynomial_expansion with multiple perfgroups
- inspected results (see subheading below)
- worked on fixing likwid stability issues
  - also discovered workaround: don't use hyperthreading. This doesn't
    completely eliminate non-deterministic behavior but it does greatly
    alleviate it
- added optional, customizable parameter string to JSON output

## This Week's Questions

### Top priority

- should we demonstrate change in behavior across many parameters? If so, how?
  by an animation? Slider?
  - should we incorporate this work with Yonghong's work in visualization?
  - this can happen later
- what new counters should we incorporate?
  - counters that help us determine:
    - [ ] port usage: are we overloading one port and preventing others from
          being used?
    - [ ] instruction decoding: can you decode instructions quickly enough?
    - [ ] micro-instruction retiring: can you fetch instructions quickly
          enough?

### Secondary

- should I visualize saturation on a per-core basis?
  - Dr. Saule: one of the use-cases might be to see load imbalance, so let's
    visualize per-core
- should I visualize double precision, single precision, or both?
  - currently picking the larger value (more saturated) and using that one
  - this visualization will eventually be somewhat hierarchical. You won't see
    all the detail at the high-level, but you can select different sections to
    "zoom in" and get a higher level of detail
  - complex applications may do single-precision for half of the execution and
    double-precision for the other half. That is full saturation overall.
  - core may be saturated for many reasons, we want to incorporate all them
    - what if you can't decode instructions fast enough?
  - "single precision flops" may be a bad metric. What if you can't support
    fma? Then you immediately lose a huge portion of performance.
- is there some way we can include execution parameters in the visualization?
  It's hard to keep track of how we generated the visualization
  - perhaps include a line that says "Command used to generate this
    visualization: <command>"

### What new counters should we use?

Look for counters that demonstrate the three main things: port usage,
instruction decoding, and micro-instruction retiring. The stuff below was
considered and only remains for the purpose of logging past work

- BRANCH: might identify when code is not doing useful computation? Is it
  fair to call branching "not useful"?
- CYCLE_STALLS: memory load reduced on optimized code for CPU-heavy params.
  Load shifted from memory to cache on mem-heavy params.
  - Interpretation of this data kinda needs knowledge of whether you're
    loading CPU or memory
  - For instance: 45% memory stalls is pretty good for memory-heavy
    parameters, but bad if we're expecting CPU to be loaded
- FALSE_SHARE: may represent locality of data access?
- "Vectorization Ratio": a metric in the FLOPS_SP and FLOPS_DP groups that
  we are currently not using, but I think is valuable information.

## Experiential results from comparing counters across polynomial and polynomial_block

- BRANCH perfgroup:
  - Branch rate: portion of instructions which branch.
    - this is lower on polynomial_block as compared to polynomial. Is this
      because of vectorization?
  - Branch misprediction rate: portion of instructions which branched to
    correct misprediction
  - Branch misprediction ratio: portion of branch instructions which branched
    to correct misprediction
  - Instructions per branch: total instructions / branch instructions
- BRANCH, cpu-heavy params:
  - polynomial_block had about 1/10th the total number of instructions
  - ratio of branch instructions to total instructions was also about
    1/10th that of un-optimized code
- BRANCH, mem-heavy params:
  - polynomial_block again had about 1/10th the total number of instructions
  - branch rate of optimized code was 1/3rd that of basic code
  - both basic and optimized code had VERY low misprediction ratios, but basic
    code was about 1/3rd that of optimized code
- CLOCK wasn't too useful. Mostly power information.
- CYCLE*ACTIVITY: CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES*\*\_PENDING / CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE
- CYCLE_ACTIVITY, cpu-heavy:
  - cycles without execution was 9.8% for basic code, 6.8% for block-optimized
    code
  - Cycles without execution due to L1D was HIGHER for optimized code. Basic
    code was 1.22%, optimized was 2.71%
  - Cycles without execution due to L2 was HIGHER for optimized code. Basic
    code was 1.05%, optimized was 3.41%
  - Cycles without execution due to memory loads was very high in both cases.
    Basic code was 94.69%, optimized code was 96.51%
- CYCLE_ACTIVITY, mem-heavy:
  - cycles without execution was 15.5% for basic code, 26.7% for block-optimized
    code
  - Cycles without execution due to L1D was HIGHER for optimized code. Basic
    code was 8.8%, optimized was 20.6%
  - Cycles without execution due to L2 was HIGHER for optimized code. Basic
    code was 8.3%, optimized was 30.2%
  - Cycles without execution due to memory loads was very high in both cases.
    Basic code was 99.74%, optimized code was 86.52%
- CYCLE_ACTIVITY interpretation:
  - Memory load was obviously shifted to caches in the optimized code...
    Also, it's natural that there wasn't nearly as much execution in the
    memory-heavy case
- CYCLE_STALLS seems very similar to CYCLE_ACTIVITY, still trying to figure
  out the differences...
  - CYCLE*ACTIVITY_STALLS*\*\_PENDING / CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE
  - haven't yet found a part of the intel documentation that makes clear the
    differences between CYCLE*ACTIVITY_STALLS*_*PENDING and
    CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES*_\_PENDING
  - descriptions in perfgroup files basically say the same thing too
  - "stalls caused by..." are the number of stalls from a given source
    divided by the total number of stalls
  - "rates" in this group are the number of stalls from a given source
    divided by the unhalted clock
- CYCLE_STALLS, cpu-heavy:
  - stall rate (total stalls / unhalted clock) is lower for optimized:
    basic code had 9.8% and optimized code had 3.5%
  - portion of stalls caused by L1D and L2 was pretty similar
  - portion of stalls caused by memory had a big difference. 37.04% for
    basic, 12.61% for optimized
- CYCLE_STALLS, mem-heavy:
  - stall rate is lower for BASIC (!): 16.42% for basic, 40.46% for opt
  - portion of stalls caused by L1D and L2 was pretty similar, though L2 was
    slightly higher for opt code. Basic was 16.64% and opt was 21.15%
  - portion of stalls caused by memory had a significant difference. 75.51%
    for basic, 45.7% for optimized
- CYCLE_STALLS interpretation:
  - clearer difference between basic/opt versions of cpu code
  - again makes clear the shift from mem to cache with optimized code
- DATA:
  - really only measures load-to-store ratio.
- DATA, cpu-heavy:
  - MUCH lower on optimized code. Basic code had a ratio of 19.09 and
    optimized code had a ratio of 1.07. Probably just a manifestation of how
    there are lower memory operations overall.
  - inspecting MEM*INST_RETIRED_ALL*\* showed that this was not exactly the
    case... optimized code had about 1/4 the loads and 4x the stores as basic
    code
- DATA, mem-heavy:
  - basic code had a ratio of 3.14, Optimized code had a ratio of 1.29
  - basic code had about 1.0e12 loads, 3.3e11 stores
  - opt code had about 8.3e10 loads, 6.4e10 stores
- DIVIDE
  - DIVIDE, cpu-heavy:
    - opt code had about 1/10th the number of divide ops
    - ratio of ARITH_DIVIDER_ACTIVE to ARITH_DIVIDER_COUNT was about the same
  - DIVIDE, mem-heavy:
    - basic code had 2e7 divides, opt had 5e5. That's about 1/40th the number
      of divides
    - ratio was again about the same
- ENERGY
  - ENERGY, cpu-heavy
    - power somewhat higher in all areas
  - ENERGY, mem-heavy
    - power somewhat higher in all areas, significantly higher (7x higher)
      for RAM
- TODO: expand sections after this one
- FALSE_SHARE
  - conceptually, false sharing is when multiple threads share a cacheline
    containing a value that will not be changed, but something else in the
    cacheline gets changed, forcing the value to be stored to memory and then
    re-loaded by all threads, even if they only use the read-only part of the
    cacheline.
  - uses two counters: MEM_INST_RETIRED_ALL (all memory instructions) and
    MEM_LOAD_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_HITM. Description in intel docs says:
    "Retired load instructions which data sources were HitM responses from
    shared L3."
  - FALSE_SHARE, cpu-heavy
    - false sharing is much higher for basic code at 166 GB vs 2 GB in the
      optimized case
    - false sharing rate (falsely shared ops / total mem ops) is also higher
      for basic code at 0.0157 (1.5%), compared with 0.0005 (0.05%) for opt
      code
  - FALSE_SHARE, mem-heavy
    - again, false sharing volumes are higher for basic code (4.08 TB??) vs
      34 GB for opt code
    - notice that in general false sharing volumes are higher
    - false sharing rates are higher for basic code as well: 0.195 vs 0.0147
      for opt
- FLOPS_AVX
  - not super useful. Just gives a subset of information available in
    FLOPS_SP and FLOPS_DP
- FLOPS_SP/FLOPS_DP vectorization ratio
  - percentage of flop operations that were vector operations
  - went from numbers in the order of 1e-10 (in basic) to 100 (in opt)
- ICACHE
  - stats like L1I request rate, L1I miss rate, and L1I stall rate
  - avg values used
  - ICACHE, cpu-heavy
    - request rate: 0.4209 in basic, 0.1442 in opt
    - miss rate: 0.0001 in basic, 0.0001 in opt
    - stall rate: 0.0005 in basic, 0.0004 in opt
  - ICACHE, mem-heavy
    - request rate: 0.1825 in basic, 0.1396 in opt
    - miss rate: 0.0004 in basic, 0.0003 in opt
    - stall rate: 0.0021 in basic, 0.0017 in opt
- L2CACHE
  - whereas the L2 performance group provides data like bandwidth and data
    volume, L2CACHE measures request rates and miss rates. Here, we will
    focus on request rates (L2 requests / total num instructions) and miss
    ratios (L2 misses / L2 requests). We will consider average rates across
    threads.
  - L2CACHE, cpu-heavy
    - |               | basic  | opt    |
      | ------------- | ------ | ------ |

      | request rate: | 0.0000 | 0.0006 |
      | miss ratio:   | 0.4930 | 0.8640 |
- PORT_USAGE\*
  - we record these already, but we don't use them in the visualization
- RECOVERY
  - RECOVERY, cpu-heavy
    - avg recovery duration: 6.0592 in basic, 5.9054 in opt

- TMA
  - intel article about this methodology: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-cookbook/top/methodologies/top-down-microarchitecture-analysis-method.html
  - one counter is "UOPS_RETIRED_RETIRE_SLOTS". Intel documentation describes
    this counter by saying "Counts the retirement slots used". The above link
    describes a slot as a theoretical place for a uop. Each cycle has four
    slots
  - IDQ_UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED_CORE: Intel docs describe this one as "Counts the
    number of uops not delivered to by the Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ) to
    the back-end of the pipeline when there were no back-end stalls. This
    event counts for one SMT thread in a given cycle."
  - INT_MISC_RECOVERY_CYCLES: Intel docs describe this one as "Core cycles
    the allocator was stalled due to recovery from earlier machine clear event
    for this thread (for example, misprediction or memory order conflict).
  - these are used to create metrics for retired, front-end bound, back-end
    bound, and badly-speculated instructions. We will evaluate those here.
    - front-end bound is calculated by IDQ_UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED_CORE/total_slots
      - 100.  In other words, fetch bubbles/total slots \* 100
    - badly-speculated percentage is calculated by finding uops not retired
      and dividing my number of slots. Finding uops not retired is somewhat
      complicated. Likwid does this by finding
      (UOPS_ISSUED_ANY-UOPS_RETIRED_RETIRE_SLOTS+(4\*INT_MISC_RECOVERY_CYCLES))
      so they include INT_MISC_RECOVERY_CYCLES as part of the ops completed
    - percent retired is simply UOPS_RETIRED_RETIRE_SLOTS/total slots \* 100
    - back-end bound is complicated and I'm not sure I understand it. So I
      will just paste the formula here
      Back End [%] = (
      1 - (
      (
      IDQ_UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED_CORE + UOPS_ISSUED_ANY + (4*INT_MISC_RECOVERY_CYCLES)
      )
      / (4 * CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE)
      )
      ) \* 100
  - All measurements are given in percentages and are averaged across threads
  - TMA, cpu-heavy
    - |                 | basic  | opt    |
      | --------------- | ------ | ------ |
      | front-end bound | 10.591 | 11.323 |
      | bad speculation | 01.029 | 00.181 |
      | retired         | 22.159 | 31.584 |
      | back-end bound  | 66.220 | 56.912 |
  - TMA, mem-heavy
    - |                 | basic  | opt    |
      | --------------- | ------ | ------ |
      | front-end bound | 08.084 | 04.665 |
      | bad speculation | 04.753 | 00.455 |
      | retired         | 05.484 | 20.653 |
      | back-end bound  | 81.678 | 74.228 |
  - Front-end stalls are due to lack of frontend bandwidth or high front-end
    latency.
  - bad speculation is caused by branch mispredicts or machine clears
  - back-end stalls are the hardest to diagnose. They can be memory-bound or
    core-bound.
    - core-bound: Are one or two ports saturated? (esp. ports that don't do
      vector operations). Are we doing scalar ops where vector ops are
      possible? Are several consecutive divide operations competing for use
      of the divide units?
    - memory bound: some level of the memory subsystem is being over-stressed.
      Is the application trying to make many stores to memory? Does the data
      structure have poor locality, preventing good caching? Do loads depend
      on prior stores?
- UOPS
  - just measures raw numbers of UOPS. less useful, probably.
  - Noticed that for the cpu case, optimized code has between 1/10th and 1/5th
    the uops issued, executed, and retired as the basic code.
  - for the mem-heavy case, the optimized code had about 1/20th the uops
    issued, 1/10 the uops executed, and 1/10th the uops retired
  - uops retired was consistently higher than uops executed.... I'm unclear
    why, because the intel documentation made it sound like retired meant
    executed, especially because uops from miss-predictions are NOT counted
    as "retired"
    - source: link at beginning of TMA section says the following: "The
      completion of a uOp’s execution is called retirement"
- UOPS_EXEC
  - measures portion of cycles were used by uops and portion that were
    stalled. Also measures average stall duration.
  - measures "the execution stage in the pipeline" according to likwid
  - UOPS_EXEC, cpu-bound:
    - |                             | basic   | opt    |
      | --------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
      | used cycles ratio [%]       | 59.513  | 86.070 |
      | stalled cycles ratio [%]    | 40.487  | 13.930 |
      | avg stall duration [cycles] | 1.18e11 | 3.56e9 |
  - UOPS_EXEC, mem-bound:
    - |                             | basic   | opt     |

      | avg stall duration [cycles] | 1.07e12 | 2.09e10 |
  - my processor runs at 2.40GHz, 2.40e9.... meaning on average a stall is
    more than 1 second??? That seems unlikely...
  - likwid calculates average stall duration with the following formula:
    Avg stall duration [cycles] = UOPS_EXECUTED_STALL_CYCLES
    / UOPS_EXECUTED_STALL_CYCLES:EDGEDETECT
- UOPS_ISSUE
  - measures "the issue stage in the pipeline" according to likwid
  - UOPS_ISSUE, cpu-bound:

      | avg stall duration [cycles] | 1.18e12 | 2.94e10 |
- UOPS_RETIRE
  - measures "the retirement stage in the pipeline (re-order buffer)"
    according to likwid

## Likwid stability issues

- some key places to check:
  - file "src/perfmon.c": perfmon_startCounters(), perfmon_setupCounters(),
    perfmon_stopCounters() are all used by likwid_markerNextGroup()
  - file "src/libperfctr.c": likwid_markerStopRegion() produces the error
    "WARN: Stopping an unknown/not-started region ..."
- "WARN: Skipping region (null) for evaluation" messages:
  - Tried printing results of computation, still had this error quite
    frequently
  - Figured this would prevent optimizing out computation, maybe it isn't?
  - other options include: volatile, #pragma GCC optimize("O0")
  - piping output of likwid_minimal to a file in the same directory
    consistently produces a LOT of these errors
  - doesn't happen when I output to /tmp/tmp.txt, which is on the same disk,
    but a different partition
- [ ] counters sometimes reporting unreasonably high values
  - many examples [available here](https://pastebin.com/u/rileyw13)
  - port counters sometimes reporting 1.8e19 for values
  - this also happens with many other counters
  - port_usage sometimes reporting 461375897600.000
  - also noticed L3 bandwidth was in the order of 1e11 or so for an
    execution of fhv_minimal in the double_flops region. This also doesn't
    make sense
    - this is the value reported by likwid, not a problem with my
      post-processing. Ran a test to demonstrate this, where I printed the
      result of `perfmon_get_MetricOfRegionThread` and then compared with
      the value I stored in my map:
    - L2 bandwidth: 8.33646e+16
      per_thread_results for thread 38.33646e+16
    - Wrote script to repeatedly run likwid_minimal. (see
      `tests/likwid_minimal_repeated.sh`). With groups
      MEM|L2|L3|FLOPS_SP|FLOPS_DP|PORT_USAGE1|PORT_USAGE2|PORT_USAGE3 all
      being measured, only 1/100 iterations produced output above 1e6. In
      this case it was L3 bandwidth and volume
    - increased number of tests to 200 and ran again. 14/200 failed, some
      of this was unreasonably high output, and some of it was "skipping
      region \_\_\_ " errors
    - switched to the groups MEM|L2|L3|FLOPS_SP|FLOPS_DP and ran another
      100 iterations. 4/100 had some kind of problem
  - ran some tests with v4.3.4 and v5.0.1, on multiple groups and just one
    group, and with hyperthreading enabled and disabled
    - hyperthreading was disabled by selecting cores 0,1 in LIKWID_THREADS and
      then setting the number of openMP threads to be 2
    - First, compiling and running with the following commands:
      g++ likwid_minimal.c -L/usr/local/likwid-v4.3.4/lib -I/usr/local/likwid-v4.3.4/include -llikwid -mtune=native -fopenmp -o likwid_minimal;
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/likwid-v4.3.4/lib PATH=/usr/local/likwid-v4.3.4/sbin:$PATH ./likwid_minimal_repeated.sh
    - Results with likwid v4.3.4:
      - No hyperthreading, specifying one group (L2): 0 failures out of 100
        tests
      - With hyperthreading, specifying one group (L2): 0 failures out of 200
        tests
        - there was one case where I received the error "WARN: Skipping
          region (null) for evaluation"
      - No hyperthreading, specifying multiple groups
        (L2|L3|FLOPS_SP|FLOPS_DP): 3 failures out of 200 tests
      - With hyperthreading, specifying multiple groups
        (L2|L3|FLOPS_SP|FLOPS_DP): 12 failures out of 100 tests
        - full output available here: https://pastebin.com/qcM34Rv6
    - next, compiled with:
      g++ likwid_minimal.c -L/usr/local/likwid-master/lib -I/usr/local/likwid-master/include -llikwid -mtune=native -fopenmp -o likwid_minimal
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/likwid-master/lib PATH=/usr/local/likwid-master/sbin:$PATH ./likwid_minimal_repeated.sh
    - Results with likwid compiled from master branch (commit
      99b0d23927f5e65cfa4eb5aeac1c57504395694b )
      - No hyperthreading, specifying one group (L2): 0 failures out of 100
        tests
      - With hyperthreading, specifying one group (L2): 0 failures out of 100
        tests
      - No hyperthreading, specifying multiple groups
        (L2|L3|FLOPS_SP|FLOPS_DP): 1 failure out of 100 tests
      - With hyperthreading, specifying multiple groups
        (L2|L3|FLOPS_SP|FLOPS_DP):5 failures out of 100 tests
        - full output: https://pastebin.com/X5MwUVUq
  - It seems to me that the problem is brought out by specifying multiple
    groups, but that it is exacerbated by hyperthreading. That being said, I
    do wonder if the hyperthreading problems have to do with intel (and the
    associated spectre/meltdown problems), I will try to test on my personal
    machine which uses an AMD processor.
  - seems to be related to error below about "stopping non-started region"
- sometimes get "stopping non-started region **\_**"
- sometimes get errors like the following:
  WARN: Skipping region double_flops-0 for evaluation.
  WARN: Skipping region copy-0 for evaluation.
  WARN: Regions are skipped because: - The region was only registered - The region was started but never stopped - The region was never started but stopped
- [ ] convolution sometimes not instrumenting one region?
  - noticed this also in fhv_minimal. Happens once every 10 executions or
    so
  - compiler optimization?

# 2020-05-17 through 2020-06-02

- worked on visualization
- created function for interpolating colors
- created function to test interpolation
- added exponential scale as discussed with Dr. Saule
  - scale(0.01) = 0.0509
  - scale(0.2) = 0.6683
  - scale(0.5) = 0.8571
- visualized saturation on a scale inspired by
  [colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=PuBu&n=9)
- found some good colors.
  - My favorite was (200, 200, 200) to (43, 140, 190) which is a light gray
    to a nice pale blue.
  - Choosing a darker blue, like (2, 56, 88) might make the differences more
    clear
  - an orange-to-blue scale like (227, 74, 51) to (43, 140, 190) was an
    interesting idea, but what the diagram was representing was less clear to
    me. I had to spend more time "learning" the scale.
- demonstrated how visualizations highlights a change in load
  - to generate memory-stressed versions, used parameters n=67108864 d=1
    nbiter=800
  - to generate CPU-stressed versions, used parameters n=67108864 d=1000
    nbiter=80
  - in both cases, used OMP_SCHEDULE="dynamic,8"
  - compare `visualizations/polynomial_basic_cpu_poly.svg` with
    `visualizations/polynomial_block_cpu_poly_block.svg` to see how CPU is
    being better utilized with the optimized code
  - compare `visualizations/polynomial_basic_mem_poly.svg` with
    `visualizations/polynomial_block_mem_poly_block.svg` to see how in general
    saturation is better (components are more evenly saturated) with the
    block code. Additionally, RAM is much more saturated.
- explored some other counters we can use
  - first identified some of code to use while experimenting with counters:
    - CONVOLUTION: found some parameters that I initially thought would stress
      the CPU, but don't indicate a bottleneck when visualized with fhv. These
      parameters are: n,m = 4000; k = 15
    - POLYNOMIAL: for the parameters n=67108864 d=1 nbiter=800, seemed like L3
      was the bottleneck? But it would be good to add some clarity
  - PORT_USAGE groups might provide some insight: for convolution, Ports 3 and
    6 reported higher saturation than the others. Port 6 was 0.12, Port 3 was
    0.10. Port 2 was a close second at 0.09 saturation. The rest were at 0.05
    or lower
- gave myself a lot of problems by forgetting to replace an optimization flag:
  - when I ran previous tests, `polynomial_block_likwid 67108864 1 10` gave a
    saturation of 0.21 for L3 cache and 0.41 for RAM. See line 14 of
    `examples/polynomial_expansion/data/block_optimized_likwid_2020-05-01_1448.csv`.
    However, now I can't replicate those results??? I'm getting saturation of
    about 0.039 for L3 and 0.082 for RAM
    - trying higher values for parameters (e.g. `polynomial_block_likwid 100000000 1 10`) yielded slightly better saturation, but nothing close
      to the `.4` I got before. Results were an L3 saturation of 0.043 and
      RAM saturation of 0.130.
    - tried closing browser, discord, gitkraken, and other resource-heavy
      applications. Results were similar.
      - for n=67108864, deg=1, got L3-sat: 0.0363, RAM-sat: 0.0748
      - for n=100000000, deg=1, got L3-sat: 0.0363, RAM-sat: 0.0797
        this is significantly lower?? weird
        The solution was (as is often the case) laughably obvious. I had removed
        the -O3 flag because I was debugging and didn't want symbols to be
        optimized out. I had never replaced it.
- worked a LOT on likwid stability issues
  - wrote on this in README.md, under the heading "likwid stability
    issues". if I remove that section, it will be copied to this document.
  - SECTION FROM README HAS BEEN COPIED INTO A HEADING ABOVE
- wrote simpler convolution for testing other counters we can use
- made polynomial expansion also have 4 different executable targets based on
  compile-time environment variables.

# 2020-04-30 through 2020-05-07

- created CSV output from fhv to allow for plotting in place of architecture
  visualization that will come later
- investigated convolution polynomial_expansion as an example kernel
- demonstrated how RAM utilization changed
- for some reason, polynomial_expansion (both basic and block) are using
  double-precision components even though "float" is used, which should (I
  think) use the single-precision data structure.
  - header did not match order of the data in lines below. It was reporting SP
    as DP, DP as L2, L2 as L3, L3 as MEM, and MEM as DP
  - fixed header to match and created a plot which showed how computation
    usage changed
- created plots to demonstrate how fhv can identify bottlenecks and
  improvements
- spent some time considering color choices to represent saturation of
  hardware
- began working on svg diagram of hardware
  - generates a couple rectangles
  - started calculating colors, need to pick a data structure to store those
    in

## Thoughts on coloring of diagram:

Notes from meeting with Dr. Saule

- anything above 20% is probably pretty well-saturated
- color by saturation (more saturation - more intense color)

my thoughts

- ideal is to have everything saturated
- how should we color this visualization? More saturated things are more
  green? Do like a red-to-green scale?
- but if only one thing is saturated, that's BAD right? because you want to
  take the load off that part and put it on others.
- but you want EVERYTHING to be loaded.... does that mean best way to color
  is by difference in lowest to highest saturation level?
- what if more saturation -> more color intensity, but the choice of color
  is based on difference between highest and lowest saturation?

Ideal: everything is 1.0

Good:

- everything is 0.5

Bad:

- something is 1.0 but other things are 0.0
- everything is 0.0

What if red denotes overuse, gray denotes under-use, and green denotes ideal
use

This sounds like the last point, where more saturation means more intensity of
color, but difference in saturation denotes green or red

Given saturation has a small range but grows from low to high:

- constant hue of 125
- start at 0.5 value, 0 saturation. Grow to 1.0 value, 1.0 saturation

Given saturation is high but changes from having a large range to having a low
range:

- constant value of 1.0 and saturation of 1.0
- start at hue of 0, grow to hue of 125

Green: Hue around 125
Red: Hue around 0
Green -> Red would be 125 -> 0

# 2020-04-23 through 2020-04-30

- added printHighlights function
- fixed geometric mean on metrics
- confirmed changes to performance_monitor still seems to match manual
  benchmark and make sense
  - this was not very rigorous, we still need unit tests at some point.
  - checked that benchmark without comparison still saturates, it does
  - manually counted the number of flops in fhv_minimal, performance_monitor
    output matches.
  - in any case, I'm just collecting and aggregating data, so the chance for
    error is lower than if I was building the data myself.
- looked at convolution for kernel to analyze
- looked at halide

# 2020-04-16 through 2020-04-23

Other Tools:

- looked at TAU
  - powerful and detailed but seems to target large clusters.
  - tools are highly specified, but there may be tools for fine-grained
    modeling
  - not intuitive
- looked at vampir
  - closer to what we are aiming for, as it provides a mapping of function to
    performance on a fine-grained level
  - does not seem to consider architecture beyond standard core-cache-memory
    common to all modern commodity hardware.
  - not free?
- read more of kerncraft paper

Kernel to use to demonstrate how this tool analyzes changing bottlenecks:

- revisited convolution
  - my theoretical analysis says memory is only the bound at kernel sizes < 5
  - in practice, I don't see a roofline from memory, but perhaps I'm not using
    core to the fullest extent?
  - for now will move on to looking at it with likwid to see if I can gain
    insights

improvements to performance_monitor tool:

- added geometric mean
- map is built for per-thread results

Checking per-thread result map for accuracy:

- events are off by a factor of 4 or so
- metrics seem to match
- events are reported for non existent threads, like
- compared new geometric mean and double checked old arithmetic mean with
  likwid_minimal. Everything seems good, moving on for now. But we will need
  formal tests at some point.

next steps:

- decide on analyzing convolution or another kernel
- use likwid to print the most pertinent information
- create json
- visualize (low-priority)

Questions:

- fix up convolution or just switch to other kernel for analysis?

# 2020-04-09 through 2020-04-16

Stuff from last week:

- Switched intrinsics to operator= (see [memory section](#memory)), compared
  compiler-produced assembly

Questions:

- how do we know port usage numbers make sense?

## Learning likwid

- pinning threads is NOT optional, but cli does it for you if you use it.
  - failure to pin threads is what was giving me problems when specifying
    groups with environment variables

## Exploration

- Shifted convolution to use direct likwid calls except to aggregate and print
  results
- For performance_monitor result printing: added ability to average results
  across core, because summing "port_usage" ratios doesn't really make sense
  - I haven't looked at convolution now that I've made these changes because I
    want to verify them again with benchmark_likwid_vs_manual

# 2020-03-24 through 2020-04-09

Main points:

- using my "performance_monitor" adds another layer of complexity that makes
  it hard to debug problems. I barely know how to use likwid, and I'm already
  writing my own library?
  - I feel like I am trying to reinvent the wheel... maybe instead of writing
    wrappers for "init" and "close" and such we can just require them to use
    the likwid calls but have a separate close/print/etc.
- have a way to measure usage by ports
- instrumenting entire "convolution" program works if you don't have the call
  to next_group, with some exceptions (see next point)
- making the number of iterations a multiple of the number of groups
  _sometimes_ fixes the preceding problem.
  - this only works sometimes, and seems to work more frequently with lower
    numbers of groups (the max number of groups I've been able to successfully
    do is 6). In general, it feels very non-deterministic and it's very
    frustrating.
  - needs more investigation now that bug has been fixed
- vector of doubles is only half the size of a cacheline. Considering every
  operation as one cacheline worth of transfer seems to be the reason those
  values are higher by a factor of 2. But why is vmovapd (move **aligned**
  packed double) allowing us to move _half_ a cacheline worth of data? Why am
  I able to use this intrinsic without error even when I supply an address
  halfway through a cacheline?
  - "aligned" does mean aligned to cacheline boundary BUT it also means that
    if you have a double aligned to cacheline, the next double still counts as
    "aligned" for those purposes.
  - internally the memory controller manages an entire cache line but gives
    the core just a part of a cache line
- using `operator=` instead of intrinsics gives higher transfer volumes that
  are closer to manually calculated volumes
- improved likwid_minimal
  - behavior changes if I compile with gcc or g++: maybe copy is getting
    optimized out?
- between `benchmark`, `benchmark-likwid-vs-manual`, `thread_migration`, and
  `convolution` there is a LOT to change whenever I make changes to
  performance_monitor. For now I'm going to leave them broken and just update
  fhv_minimal. If we use them in the future I think I'm going to switch to
  just calling likwid until fhv is more stable
- found it difficult to search through the vast amount of stuff other people
  are doing
- in the case of kerncraft, they present a roofline model by level of cache
  and memory as well as a scalability model

Feeling a little overwhelmed. I've struggled this week and it's made me aware
of how little I know. I feel like I need to learn about:

- how likwid works. Read the documentation and examples.
- how caching and memory works
- how floating-point arithmetic works
- what exactly other people are doing

Not to mention actually building this library

## Playing with likwid_minimal.c

Through the likwid-users group, I discovered that you have to put barriers
between stop/start regions

Noticed some really weird behavior.

- reproduced bug in convolution where if I supply too many groups, program
  hangs on likwid_markerClose.
  - ran likwid_minimal with the command `likwid-perfctr -C S0:0-3 -g FLOPS_DP -g MEM -g L3 -g L2 -M 1 -m ./likwid_minimal` to reproduce
  - asked about this on the likwid_users group: see
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/likwid-users/XDLIHYdeRy4
- if I compile with g++ things work perfectly. If I compile with gcc, I get
  the error "WARN: Stopping an unknown/not-started region double_flops"
- v5.0.1 is buggy, v4.3.4 does not support counters for memory (like MBOX0C1)
  - the bug is detailed here:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/likwid-users/XDLIHYdeRy4
  - v5.0.1 was fixed with commit [52d450](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/commit/52d45038ba7dbc7e41c0d44818367fb891257b47)

## Improvements to performance_monitor

- now separates sequential and parallel regions, which are registered in init
- overloaded init to allow specifying a number of threads instead of
  enumerating them in a c string
- created wrapper function for nextGroup

## What other people are doing

- feel like I could spend weeks just learning about what other tools do
- Read a lot about kerncraft, [added a section on it](#kerncraft) in the
  `other similar tools` section. Highlights follow:
  - only instruments loops, not multi-stage programs
  - does an automatic benchmark
  - seems architecture information has to be manually written
- one of my biggest questions: How can we better take advantage of what other
  people are using?
  - use likwid-perfctr command line? But then we'd have to scrape the output
    to use results programmatically
  - use likwid_benchmark_auto.py to benchmark code?

## Convolution as a case study

Commenting the line `likwid_markerNextGroup()` caused it to work with two
regions. Switched to raw likwid instead of using my performance_monitor wrapper

## Investigating port usage

Tried to calculate port usage. Created 3 custom groups so we could calculate
port usage. Currently exploring if UOPS*EXECUTED_CORE, UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD, or
UOPS_ISSUED_ANY provides counts that are the same as summing all
UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT_PORT*\*

Really struggled with getting errors in likwid. I feel like I need to spend
more time reading the documentation.

Ran a test that counts each of UOPS_EXECUTED_CORE, UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD, and
UOPS_ISSUED_ANY. On one core, these are the results I get:

+-----------------------+---------+----------+
| Event | Counter | Core 0 |
+-----------------------+---------+----------+
| INSTR_RETIRED_ANY | FIXC0 | 30003500 |
| CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE | FIXC1 | 40271970 |
| CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_REF | FIXC2 | 33897450 |
| UOPS_EXECUTED_CORE | PMC0 | 27690410 |
| UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD | PMC1 | 20082810 |
| UOPS_ISSUED_ANY | PMC2 | 20121590 |
+-----------------------+---------+----------+

I summed up the individual port counts by running the same program multiple
times with different ports counted each time:

PORT 0 | 4979574
PORT 1 | 5024232
PORT 2 | 861
PORT 3 | 924
PORT 4 | 801
PORT 5 | 10317
PORT 6 | 10004330
PORT 7 | 363

SUM | 2.00E+07

UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD (from above): 2.01E+07
UOPS_ISSUED_ANY (from above): 2.01E+07

Here, both UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD and UOPS_ISSUED_ANY seem to match with the sum
of all ports. However, when I run the same code in parallel, things get weird:

+----------------------------+---------+-----------+
| Event | Counter | Sum |
+----------------------------+---------+-----------+
| INSTR_RETIRED_ANY STAT | FIXC0 | 120495560 |
| CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE STAT | FIXC1 | 166349120 |
| CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_REF STAT | FIXC2 | 143447620 |
| UOPS_EXECUTED_CORE STAT | PMC0 | 161796390 |
| UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD STAT | PMC1 | 80585430 |
| UOPS_ISSUED_ANY STAT | PMC2 | 80664620 |
+----------------------------+---------+-----------+

(the numbers reported below are the sums of counters in each core)

PORT 0 | 19960933
PORT 1 | 20443779
PORT 2 | 60018
PORT 3 | 485226
PORT 4 | 1.84E+19
PORT 5 | 578111
PORT 6 | 42519460
PORT 7 | 568032

SUM | 1.84E+19

UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD (from above): 8.09E+07
UOPS_ISSUED_ANY (from above): 8.10E+07

Notice that the number of operations reported on port 4 are incredibly high.
Here's the core-by-core results:

+-----------------------------+---------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+
| Event | Counter | Core 0 | Core 1 | Core 2 | Core 3 |
+-----------------------------+---------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+
| INSTR_RETIRED_ANY | FIXC0 | 30946300 | 30944860 | 42940730 | 30895580 |
| CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE | FIXC1 | 60802980 | 58707880 | 55233110 | 59092460 |
| CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_REF | FIXC2 | 52916970 | 51040180 | 48027820 | 51370380 |
| UOPS_EXECUTED_CORE | PMC0 | 58303410 | 41440210 | 54157630 | 41846800 |
| UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT_PORT_3 | PMC1 | 68465 | 85618 | 2454614 | 61633 |
| UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT_PORT_4 | PMC2 | 903 | 21707 | 1959782 | 1.844674e+19 |
| UOPS_DISPATCHED_PORT_PORT_5 | PMC3 | 126036 | 64438 | 3186109 | 102977 |
+-----------------------------+---------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+

For some reason, core 3 reports huge numbers for uops dispatched on port 4.
Odd. I looked at the skylake architecture again, port 4 is responsible for one
thing only: storing data. With this in mind, one core having more UOPS would
make sense, maybe the hardware only allows one core at a time to do store
operations because issuing operations is certainly not the bottleneck in memory
write performance. However, this does not explain the sheer volume of
instructions. How does 1.8e19 instructions make sense when there were only
5.9e7 cycles?

I've run this program a few times and I only seem to get this result (1.84e19)
sometimes. And sometimes I get that result on the value for PORT_7. I believe
it's a bug or an error of some kind. Seems to behave better if the number of
iterations is increased.

## Applying port usage information to convolution

If the number of iterations where `likwid_markerNextGroup()` is called is a
multiple of the number of groups, things USUALLY behave well. If not:

Trying to just tack on port_usage groups to the existing MEM_DP|FLOPS_SP etc.
makes likwid hang indefinitely on its analysis after convolution is run.

instrumenting "entire_program" works if I comment out likwid_markerNextGroup()
OR if the number of iterations is a multiple of the number of groups.
Sometimes. This is very non-deterministic and it's frustrating. Making the
number of iterations a multiple of the number of groups SOMETIMES works, but as
the number of groups increases it seems to work less well.

## Memory

Inspected assembly. Summary of findings:

- compared intrinsics and assignment with operator=
- There is one read and one write instruction per iteration in both cases
- data volumes as calculated from number of retired instructions are off by a
  factor of 2. Is this because the instructions only move _half_ a cacheline
  for some reason? Is that even possible? A vector of doubles is 256 bytes, so
  half a cacheline.
- I realized when using intrinsics, I was trying to use intrinsic for aligned
  values at unaligned addresses. What is the behavior when this happens?
- when using operator=, volumes reported by likwid are higher and closer to
  manually calculated values

```
vmovapd	(%r14,%rax,8), %ymm0	# MEM[base: array_12, index: j_31, step: 8, offset: 0B], _22
vmovapd %ymm0, 0(%r13,%rax,8) # _22, MEM[base: copy_array_11, index: j_31, step: 8, offset: 0B]
```

seems to correspond with loading `array + j` into `buffer` and then storing
`buffer` into `copy_array + j`

Can this instruction load less than a cache line? Cache line size is 64 bytes
or 512 bits. In this case, the command could move only 256 bits per call
(half a cache line). However, movapd is the instruction for "move _aligned_
packed double-precision floating-point values". And it looks like I didn't
think about alignment while writing the benchmark because I try to do a load in
the middle of a cache line. So maybe those instructions just don't happen? I
don't know how the hardware handles invalid commands.

Another theory: since vmovapd only moves a vector of doubles, maybe that just
means my manually calculated data is off because it is only 32 bytes per
instruction, not 64? "Volume by retired instructions" is off by about a factor
of two, so this sounds reasonable.

I tried switching to regular assignment without intrinsics and the assembly
instead uses **vmovsd** (vector move scalar double... seems like an oxymoron)
and now includes what seems to be six per iteration. However, there are a lot
of complicated jump statements and likwid reports the same number of retired
instructions so it's probably still just two per loop.

Strangely, memory volume as reported by likwid was higher in L3 and Memory when
using direct assignment instead of the intrinsic. These higher values were
closer to calculated volumes. Why?

## Memory

- MEM_INST_RETIRED_ALL_LOAD/STORE count all retired load/store instructions,
  respectively. See Table 19-3 of "Performance monitoring events" in intel
  developer's guide
- using these to get load/store ratios gave us ratios of 4-6x reads to writes
  (see `tests/mem_volume_through_cache_load_to_store.png`)
- Tried to get absolute measurement of volume of data transferred.
  - Couldn't find counter of L1 memory instructions besides evict/read (which
    we already use in L2 measurements) so I tried using
    MEM_INSTR_RETIRED_LOADS_ALL. See
    `tests/mem_volume_through_cache_total_volume.png`

## What other people are doing

- browsed some projects on github
  - searching "hardware counters" turned up countless projects that just
    expose hardware counters in language X

## Memory: tried to align memory manual calculations with likwid report

- likwid is reporting less data transferred, even in best case manually
  calculated transfer amounts are 1.25x the likwid reported ones. See
  `./tests/mem_size_comparison_size_ratio.png`
- compared ratio of reads to writes in each level of cache/memory
   - expected ratio to be 2:1 in cache and 1:1 in memory.. not the case
  - at small volumes, ratio of reads to writes was very high: maybe writeback
    just hasn't happened while we're instrumenting things?
     - at high volumes, L2 was 2:1, ram was about 1.5:1, and L3 was about 1:1
      (see the chart `./tests/mem_volume_through_cache_ratios.png`)
- compared volume of data through every level of cache/memory (see the charts
  mem_volume_through_cache_X.png where X is l2, l3, and memory)
   - expected volume reported in RAM and caches to match at higher volumes.
    This was the case except for with L2, which was significantly lower. See
    mem_volume_through_cache_total_volume.png
- the counter "COREWB" (Counts the number of modified cachelines written
  back.) may be useful here
  - doesn't work on my arch (skylake). It works on Haswell according to the
    intel developer's guide

## Convolution as a case study

- worked on debugging why entire_program region doesn't work
  - Initial theories proved not to be correct. Some things I considered:
    - likwid doesn't allow nested groups. But, even after removing inner group
      was not fixed
    - trying to initialize in a parallel block caused it to fail because the
      threads were getting destroyed or something, but even when starting and
      stopping the group in a sequential block, no results.
    - maybe it was getting counted but just not in all threads or something?
      But aggregate results were the same whether the region `entire` was
      specified or not
  - googled the error I got, only result was to the source code where the
    error is printed
  - I'm not even sure how to ask a question about this. Maybe need to make a
    minimal example to post to discussion board? Just ask "what's wrong?"?
- discovered PORT_USAGE performance group that we can look into to analyze
  stuff inside the core. Will need to split it into two groups though

## When both groups were started/stopped:

----- begin saturation level performance_monitor report -----
Percentage of available DP [MFLOP/s] used: 1.05821e-05
Percentage of available L2 bandwidth [MBytes/s] used: 0.0242764
Percentage of available L3 bandwidth [MBytes/s] used: 0.0197555
Percentage of available Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] used: 0.108281
Percentage of available SP [MFLOP/s] used: 0.0298234
----- end saturation level performance_monitor report -----

## When only actual convolution was inside group:

----- begin saturation level performance_monitor report -----
Percentage of available DP [MFLOP/s] used: 8.11656e-06
Percentage of available L2 bandwidth [MBytes/s] used: 0.0215583
Percentage of available L3 bandwidth [MBytes/s] used: 0.0364879
Percentage of available Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] used: 0.0938187
Percentage of available SP [MFLOP/s] used: 0.0249263
----- end saturation level performance_monitor report -----

## Analysis

Results are similar.... saturation levels differ on speedtest but the kernel is
also bigger

## QOL and software engineering

- Performance monitor now automatically aggregates all metrics and events
- flops plots now have annotated times of execution
- Figured out how to supply multiple performance groups in code
- **Software Engineering:** trying to build a deliverable as quickly as
  possible has caused some problems with unmaintainable code, so I spent some
  time this week on software engineering stuff
  - improved performance monitor to automatically aggregate every event and
    metric
    - this dramatic refactoring has made me aware of the need for **unit
      tests**.... should we do that soon?
  - would be nice to combine benchmark and benchmark_compare_likwid_manual

# 2020-03-03 through 2020-03-10

- tried to align manual memory benchmark and likwid benchmark, learned a few
  things:
  - manual benchmark now counts read and write in each iteration (2 ops per
    iteration)
  - found some related intrinsics:
    - \_mm256_stream_load_si256 reads non-temporally
    - \_mm256_stream_pd stores non-temporally
    - streaming loads only seem to be supported with integer data for some
      reason
    - (non-temporal means it goes into queue as LEAST-recently read thing
      instead of most-recently read thing)
  - aligning memory is proving to be harder than aligning flops. Amount of
    memory reported as transferred by likwid changes each time. However, it
    also never exceeds the manually calculated amount
  - likwid measures:
    - Memory load bandwidth [MBytes/s] 1.0E-06*DRAM_READS*64.0/time
    - Memory evict bandwidth [MBytes/s] 1.0E-06*DRAM_WRITES*64.0/time
  - so it seems likwid measures read and write. Does not seem to count the
    read for ownership part of the write as a read operation, as there were
    about 20% more reads than writes in benchmark, which is expected to be at
    least double the number of writes if read for ownership is counted.
  - maybe there's no read for ownership since L3 cache is shared across all
    cores and there's only one processor
- aligned manual FLOP benchmark with likwid benchmark
  - made graphs to show reports from each, they get closer as time spent
    computing increases
- CLI
  - ended up writing cli for manual vs likwid because that's what I was
    working with the most. Still useful to figure out program options
  - couldn't get program_options to work, either from apt or when building from
    source. Would get linker errors even with supplied examples
    - PROBLEM WAS THE ORDER OF FLAGS GIVEN TO G++ WOW I SPENT LIKE 2 HOURS ON
      THIS. You have to put -lboost_program_options AFTER the file you're
      linking

# 2020-02-25 through 2020-03-03

- double check bandwidth by doing manual calculations
  - only one core is reporting work even though I'm using multiple threads...
  - is bandwidth too low to be taken advantage of by all cores? Or does the
    memory controller only allow one core at a time to use it? Or maybe it's
    just how likwid reports things?
  - when I make code sequential, all threads but thread 0 report NAN values
    for ram-related stuff. Also bandwidth is halved. I think this is just how
    likwid reports things?
  - results are off by a factor of 2...
- added HPC convolution to test
  - instrument loading/saving data too - different phases to application
  - this has been added, but only able to instrument actual convolution for
    some reason?
  - some minor fixes: aggregates all fp operations, not just avx ones
- changed performance_monitor functions to static
- outputs data to JSON now
- started executable which will bench system and visualize from json
- multiple groups now specified

# 2020-02-18 through 25

- planning on using svgpp for svg generation https://github.com/svgpp/svgpp
- not sure how to supply multiple groups from within code...
  - if I can find a way to close and re-init without segfaulting, I could just
    do that
  - feels a little hacky though.
  - I asked on the likwid-users google group if there's a way to specify
    multiple groups using the environment variable LIKWID_EVENTS
- would this be easier to write as a likwid extension?
- hardcode architecture and result of benchmark

The way likwid measures cache bandwidth is interesting. Following is an example
with L2 cache:

- measures L1D_REPLACEMENT, L1D_M_EVICT, and ICACHE_64B_IFTAG_MISS
- calculates the following:
  - L2D load bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*L1D_REPLACEMENT*64.0/time
  - L2D load data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*L1D_REPLACEMENT*64.0
  - L2D evict bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*L1D_M_EVICT*64.0/time
  - L2D evict data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*L1D_M_EVICT*64.0
  - L2 bandwidth [MBytes/s] =
    1.0E-06*(L1D_REPLACEMENT+L1D_M_EVICT+ICACHE_64B_IFTAG_MISS)*64.0/time
  - L2 data volume [GBytes] =
    1.0E-09*(L1D_REPLACEMENT+L1D_M_EVICT+ICACHE_64B_IFTAG_MISS)*64.0

Do we want to separate out load/evict?

Learned some things about memory:

- counters associated with DRAM obtained when running brandon's bw program
  with size 100000 and number of iterations 10:
  - DRAM_READS:MBOX0C1: 18446740000000000000.000000
  - DRAM_WRITES:MBOX0C2: 321320900.000000
  - Metric Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s]: 464390389739345.750000 (this seems
    unreasonably high...)
- there are benchmarks for memory. For instance `likwid-bench -t copy -w S0:100MB`

these came from the group "MEM_DP", which also happened to include a lot of
information about DP flops

# 2020-02-11 through 18

## Misc. discoveries:

- discovered "vectorization ratio" metric in likwid
- there are counters for NVIDIA gpus - use the -W flag in likwid-perfctr
- event groups are stored in $(PREFIX)/share/likwid/perfgroups/$(ARCH)/
  - ex /usr/local/share/likwid/perfgroups/skylakeFLOPS_SP.txt
- custom groups can be specified as described here:
  https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/wiki/likwid-perfctr#using-custom-event-sets
- likwid measures by hardware thread; hardware counter registers are part of
  context switch when hyperthreading
- doesn't seem possible to re-initialize likwid inside code, so you can't
  change the group name once it's set without restarting the executable.
- likwid_startCounters() should be run once in sequential part of code,
  otherwise counters were getting restarted and results were not correct. I
  moved it to "init" in performance_monitor.
- can use likwid-accessD to avoid need for sudo. This also monitors at hardware
  level, results are consistent with using direct access.

## Integer operations:

- Measuring integer operations is tough...
  - some counters count both FP and INT operations, could in theory subtract
    FP ops. (See ARITH.MUL, MUL, DIV)
  - some counters only count integer vector things (see
    SIMD_INT_128.PACKED_MP&). Unfortunately, I didn't see anything for 256B or
    512B registers

## Sampling:

- no extrapolation is done on counters.
- when specifying multiple groups, likwid switches which group is tracked when
  likwid_markerNextGroup is called if the marker api is used. Else, the group
  being tracked switches after the time specified with the -T flag passes
  (default 2s)
  - for example: `likwid-perfctr -C S0:0 -g FLOPS_DP -g L3 -g L3 -T 250ms -M 1 ./a.out`

## Number of Registers for hardware counters

- on my CPU (intel i5-6300U, skylake) there are 4 customizable hardware
  counter registers per hardware thread and 8 are available per hardware core
  if hyperthreading is disabled. These are numbered PMC0-7
- the registers used for hardware counters are part of the context switch!
- FIXC0-2 are not customizable

## Threads and migration

- NOTE: expected performance is 371 GFlop/s
- pin 1 omp thread to each physical thread
  - 193.8 GFlop/s
- pin 1 omp thread to each physical core
  - pinned one omp thread to core 0 and one thread to core 2
  - got 100.1 GFlop/s
- pin multiple omp threads to one physical thread
  - according to
    https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/wiki/TutorialMarkerC#problems , this
    is not supported. Access to hash table entries is not thread safe
  - I tried it anyways.
    - most threads reported "-22" for all counters... some kind of code?
    - still did all operations
    - reported 56.8 GFlop/s, which is about 1/4 our 4-core measurement and
      1/2 our 2-core measurement
    - results were incredibly inconsistent and changed based on if I used
      accessD or direct access.
- general notes on thread migration
  - see tests/thread_migration.cpp
  - used likwid_pinThread to migrate threads
  - note: IDs reported by omp_get_thread_num do not change when cores are
    migrated! I assume this is because the IDs are unique to OpenMP threads,
    not physical cores
  - SCHED_GETCPU(3) will tell you what core is being used
- swap odd and even cores
  - only even-numbered omp threads were allowed to do work, but odd cores
    also reported data. This indicates that likwid checks on a hardware
    thread level and not by omp thread.
- instead of swapping even and odd, started on cores 1 and 2 and moved to
  cores 3 and 4
  - when I did start region -> run1 -> migrate -> run2 -> stop region, I
    got "WARN: Stopping an unknown/not-started region flops". So sometimes
    one thread would start a region and another would stop it... this is
    interesting, and further reinforces the theory that regions and stuff
    is done on a hardware-thread level
  - adding "#pragma omp barrier" after starting regions and before stopping
    them" made everything report work every time
  - for all cores to report work, region had to be started before doing
    work/migration/work and then stopped after all that was done. Doing
    start/work/stop/migration/start/work/stop caused only some cores to report
    work.
- move single thread from core 0 to core 2
  - seems that if you start region on one core and stop on another, nothing
    is reported
  - starting region on one core, switching to another, doing work,
    switching back to first, and stopping region causes only first core to
    report work
  - results inconsistent.... not sure what this means yet

# before 2020-02-11

- evaluated both likwid and papi for use
- investigated likwid-bench
- basic research on likwid-accessD vs direct access
- Got likwid marker to measure code
  - investigated brandon's code
  - got my code working
- Investigated how likwid aggregates
  - aggregates by region but on a per-thread basis
  - if two regions have the same name and they are on the same thread, they
    will be aggregated.
- Group "FLOPS_SP" and "FLOPS_DP" seem useful.

## Some notes on what does and doesn't get counted:

FP_ARITH_INST_RETIRED_256B_PACKED_SINGLE STAT counts one vector operation as
one retired instruction.
It counts one vector FMA operation as 2 retired instructions

AVX SP MFLOP/s counts vector operation as 8 floating point operations: This
is what we want

so aggregate AVX SP MFLOP/s should correspond with what we expect on bench
